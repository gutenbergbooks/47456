<p>The picture opposite the title-page is a reprint of
a page from the volume of plates, made in 1771, to
illustrate Diderot’s Encyclopædia. This page is
one of six, each 8×12 ins. in the original, illustrating
the article in the encyclopædia on binding.</p>

<p>The picture in the upper part of the plate represents
a binder’s workshop. The person at A is beating
a book. The woman at B is sewing. The man
at C is cutting or trimming the edges of a book.
The man at D is working a press.</p>

<p>Of the figures below: 1 is a piece of marble on
which books are beaten; 2 is a piece of marble of
different shape for the same purpose; 3 is a beating
hammer; 4 is a sewing table or bench, on which
books are sewn; 5 and 6 are balls of thread for sewing
books; 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 are parts of a
sewing bench; 13 and 14 are large and small paper
folders.</p>

<p>“The fourth is, to retrench &amp; cut off all the
superfluous expences, which many prodigally and
to no purpose bestow upon the binding and ornaments
of their Books, and to employ it in purchasing
such as they want, that so they may not be
obnoxious to that censure of <cite>Seneca</cite>, who handsomly
reproaches those, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quibus voluminum suorum
frontes maxime placent titulique;</i> &amp; this the rather,
that the binding is nothing but an accident &amp; form
of appearing, without which (at least so splendid
and sumptuous) Books become altogether as useful,
commode &amp; rare; it becoming the ignorant onely to
esteem a Book for its cover; seeing it is not with
Books, as it is with men, who are onely known and
respected for their robes and their clothes, so that
it is a great deal better, and more necessary, for
example, to have a good quantity of Books, well
&amp; ordinarily bound, than to have a little Chamber
or Cabinet full of washed, gilded, ruled, and enriched
with all manner of nicity, lux and superfluity.”</p>

“Instructions Concerning Erecting of a Library.”

<h2><span class="subhead"><a name="Preface_to_Second_and_Revised_Edition" id="Preface_to_Second_and_Revised_Edition">Preface to Second and Revised Edition</a></span></h2>

<p>In the first edition of this book I said that it
ought not to be taken as a final authority, but as
a set of suggestions which I hoped would arouse
interest in the subject of library binding and lead
a few to pursue the subject further. Some of the
changes made for this edition indicate that I have
followed the topic a little further myself,—I hope
with advantage to my readers.</p>

<p>Several chapters are new. There are many minor
changes and omissions. The lists have been enlarged
and brought into one.</p>

<p>I had looked into the subject of library binding
and discovered the ignorance concerning it of American
librarians, including myself, before I visited Mr.
Chivers’ beautiful bindery in Bath, England, several
years ago. That visit had much to do with the contents
of this little book. Mr. Chivers was quite of
my opinion that the only way to induce librarians in
America to improve our binding was to persuade us
to look into the subject. If the book has led some
to do this it has accomplished its purpose. As to
the fundamental points in it, they largely come, I
am pleased to confess, from England, by way of that
bindery in Bath.</p>

<p>At the risk of seeming to speak to commercial
ends I quote in effect some of the things said by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Mr. Chivers in one of his circulars, prefacing the
quotation with the remark that the point I wish
chiefly to make in this book is the advantage of
having certain books, when new, bound once for all:</p>

<p>“The following statement is not an exaggeration:
A library saves half the cost of new popular books,
and of replacements for which much use may be
anticipated, if it purchases them in Cedric Chivers’
patent bindings. New books supplied in these bindings
are sold as being bound once for all. It is thought
that they are so bound as to serve for quite fifty per
cent. more issues than will a book purchased in
publisher’s cloth, used for a time, and then rebound
in the ordinary way. Generally speaking such results
and even better results are obtained. Occasionally,
however, a book does not come up to these expectations.
In such cases it is especially desired that
its failure be reported and, if necessary, that the
book be returned for examination. The paper used
in modern books is of such varying quality that it
is sometimes difficult to tell without actually trying
what is the best manner of treating it.”</p>

<p>Buy books well bound direct from publishers’
sheets; mend ordinary books very little; rebind them
early; watch results; tabulate them, and make use
of experience. These are the main themes of this
book.</p>

<p>As the title indicates these notes have been compiled
in the hope that they may be of assistance to
librarians in caring for the binding and rebinding
of library books. They hardly touch upon publishers’
binding or the decoration of bindings. The suggestions
and advice they give should not be taken as
final, for the binding and rebinding question is not
yet settled. They may help some to carry out
more successfully their own inquiries and experiments.
If good binders were more common librarians
would need little of the information here briefly set
forth. But under the present conditions of the bookbinder’s
art in this country librarians themselves
must often furnish considerable expert knowledge, if
they wish their work well done.</p>

<p>I have refrained from going much into the details
of the process of binding. The details can only be
made clear by means of illustrations, and have
already been most admirably set forth in Douglas
Cockerell’s book. I have tried to draw attention to
the important points. The librarian ought to know
good results when he sees them, or at least when
he tests them on his books; the details of every
step he can learn if he will, by a little practice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
a good deal of observation. No librarian should try
to bind or to conduct personally his own bindery.
Binding is a special trade, and skill and speed in it
come only by long practice. The librarian cannot
become a skilled binder. He should become familiar
with the results of the binding he gets by a study
of his books. If he finds they do not wear well,
but rot, break or show loose pages, let him keep a
few statistics, and if he learns he is wasting money
on cheap work or poor material, let him change his
material and his processes, and perhaps his binder.
I hope this book may lead some to test the work
they are now getting, and may help some to get
more satisfactory workmanship and more enduring
materials. It is not a guide to the craft of binding.
To get good binding, go to a good binder; to learn
about the binding craft, practice it and read Cockerell;
to discover if your binding is good, watch it
and gather statistics of its wear.</p>

<p>Much of the information, many reports of experiences
and many suggestions will be found in the
lists of leathers, etc., and definitions of terms used
in binding. It seemed unwise to repeat them as
part of a connected text.</p>

<p>In considering the subject of economical binding
and rebinding for libraries, we find that we are
entirely without standards. We have no figures for
comparisons. Librarians have, save in a very few
cases, made no study of the comparative value of
bindings, either of original cloth or of the rebindings
they have had put on their books. If a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
librarians would note the number of times books
can be issued without rebinding after they are
received in the original publisher’s cloth, and how
many issues they will stand after they have been
once, or twice, rebound, they would, in a few months,
have data from which they could draw helpful conclusions
in regard to the comparative value of bindings
and rebindings.</p>

<p>The test of a binding, whether publisher’s original,
special from the sheets, or a rebinding, lies, for ordinary
lending books, in the ratio of its cost to the
number of times the book it covers is lent for home
use before being discarded. This ratio has rarely
been systematically noted.</p>

<p>To the inquiry, does the method of rebinding
which my library now employs give the best possible
return for the money spent? most librarians must
reply that they do not know.</p>

<p>Reference and college libraries are often also
much in the dark. The continued quite general use
for permanent bindings of a leather which tests have
shown will not last over 25 or 30 years at the most
is an evidence of this.</p>

<p>In England, as is well known, a good many years
of careful observation and comparison of experiments
have led a large number of librarians to the
conclusion which some American librarians also
accept, that it is the part of sound economy to have
books carefully bound directly from publishers’ sheets,
even though the prices of such bindings seem at
first unduly high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>I sent a letter of inquiry to a large number of
libraries asking for detailed information about the
wear of books in publishers’ bindings and in the
one or more rebindings which were placed on them.
Replies were received from 18 libraries, giving brief
life histories of 74 books. Definite conclusions cannot
be drawn from these reports, as librarians differ
much in their ways of treating books. Some rebind
them as soon as they show serious signs of wear;
others keep them in circulation long after they have
begun to go to pieces. But the figures indicate that
it would pay these libraries, as it probably would
all others, to get most of the books which are to be
subjected to much handling strongly bound direct
from publishers’ sheets.</p>

<p>The reports show that 74 books cost, including first
price, rebinding and labor of handling for rebinding,
an average of $1.38 each; that they were lent an
average of 79 times in the two states, new and rebound;
and that they were out of use an average of
five weeks while being rebound. A book of a
nature similar to those reported on, well-bound
from publishers’ sheets costs about $1.50; can be
lent from 100 to 150 times and loses no time in being
rebound.</p>

<p class="margin-at-bottom">Of these books 52 were rebound a second time at an
average cost, including labor in preparation, of 40
cents; were out of use an average of five weeks; and
were lent an average of 43 times each in this second
binding. The complete history of the books a second
time rebound is as follows:</p>

<p class="p1 margin-at-bottom">These figures do not tell the whole story. The
book bound strongly and flexibly from publishers’
sheets is from the first more convenient to handle
and pleasanter to read, and usually looks better
throughout all its one long life than do, on the average,
those books which twice or thrice in their histories
get into a broken-backed, loose-leaved, generally
disreputable condition. Furthermore, and this
is most important, a book is most wanted in a library
when it is new; if sent out to be rebound for five
and a half weeks after it has been lent 32 times it is
out of use just when it is most in demand; and the
library loses in its effectiveness—that is, in the service
it can render its public for the money expended—much
more than the mere difference in the money
cost of the two kinds of binding would indicate. The
durable first binding gives us a book which can be
in constant service from 100 to 150 times from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
day it goes to the shelves, just when it is most needed.
A book once or twice rebound in the first few months
of its life is a special source of annoyance—the paradox
is permissible—by its very absence.</p>

<p class="p2">In the Newark library an examination of 56 books,
chiefly novels, from 15 or 20 different publishers,
shows that on the average they were lent in publishers’
binding only 25 times each before being rebound;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and that 42 books in the juvenile department were
lent in the publishers’ binding an average of only 17
times each.</p>

<p>In bindings and rebindings one of the most essential
things to be secured is ease of opening. A book
that opens out easily, and lies flat without being
pressed or held in position, will probably keep clean
and whole for more than twice as many lendings as
one that is held together tightly at the back. As a
great many of the library books which call for rebindings
have to be trimmed at the back and overcast,
it is essential that the overcast sewing be of a flexible
nature, one that permits of the easy opening of the
book. Probably few of the factors in book construction
and book injury have been more effective
than the tight binding, held open with difficulty,
which is produced by nearly all of the current overcasting
or whipstitching.</p>

<p>Another point that cannot be too strongly insisted
on is that books not only differ from one another in
their natures and so require different treatment in
binding; but also differ in the use they are to receive,
and require different bindings on that account.</p>

<p>It should be understood that bookbinding is a
craft in the best sense of that word. To bind a book
well calls for good judgment and care at every step.
The librarian can draw up schedules with infinity of
detail, and make them as correct as he may please,
basing them on experience without end; and the
binder, so far as material and processes are concerned,
may seem to follow these specifications exactly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
still may produce poor bindings. To secure a good
binding the spirit of the binder must go into it. In
drawing the thread, in paring and placing the leather,
in applying the paste and glue, and in every other
of the many processes involved, the man without
good will, as the man without skill, can spoil the
whole binding. Librarians should learn to esteem
bookbinding highly. It is a craft which lies close
to them. It is preëminently their business to encourage
it to grow in excellence. They should develop
their local binder’s interest in his calling, stand by
him, urge him on to better work, and pay him adequately
for it.</p>

<p>One may frankly say that the character of binding
done in nearly all libraries in America has been,
up to the present time, a discredit to the library profession.
We owe it to ourselves to take up this craft
and do what we can to elevate it.</p>

<p>One objection sometimes made to bindings of the
highest grade is that they last too long; and after the
book is too greatly soiled and tattered within to be
longer kept, the binding itself still holds, showing
that more care has been put into its construction,
and consequently more cost, than it needed. The
objection needs only to be stated for its absurdity
to be seen. The thorough binder, the skilled craftsman,
adapts his binding to the book and to the use,
as far as he can judge of it, which it is to receive.</p>

<p>He binds each book so well that it will hold together
to the end of time; or until its paper fairly drops to
pieces. He can issue with each volume no guarantee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
that it will not receive more than its proper baptism
of dirt from careless borrowers long before the paper
in it begins to give way and fray out. The binder’s
obligation is to bind the book well. It is the librarian’s
business to see that the book is, as to its interior,
well treated. As to its binding lasting too long,
why should the librarian concern himself about the
shell after the kernel is eaten? It should be noted
again, however, that a book well bound, opening
easily, and lying open without pressure from fingers
or thumbs, keeps clean many times longer than one
that opens hard.</p>

<p>The sum of all my observations is, the best is the
cheapest. If a book is worth binding let it be bound
by the best man available. If possible, buy books
so well bound from the publishers’ sheets, that they
will never need to be bound again.</p>

</h2>

<p>Books are now printed in large sheets from 4 to
64 pages at a time. In many cases paper is drawn
from a roll (as it is in the printing of a newspaper),
printed on both sides in large sections of 64 pages,
and cut and folded as it leaves the press. These
sheets, of several pages each, after being printed,
are gathered into a complete book, sometimes by a
machine, and are then sewn together by a machine.
This machine for sewing is a comparatively recent
invention. In most cases sewing done on a machine
is not as strong as the old-fashioned hand sewing.
The sections, or signatures, or folds of the book, as
the several sets of several pages each are called, are
caught together only by thread; strings or tapes are
not used. This sewing is then reinforced by a piece
of cloth, usually thin, cheap muslin, or poor super,
which is pasted over the back and allowed to extend
a little way down each side. But sewing on a machine
can be done with strings added and made very
strong.</p>

<p class="displayNone"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p>Covers for books are now made by machines into
which are fed pieces of cardboard and a roll of cloth.
The machine cuts the cloth into the proper size,
pastes it and folds it over the boards into a cover,
leaving a loose place between the two boards to be
filled by the body of the book. This cover is then
printed in a machine much like a printing press;
the gold of the title on the back or sides or both,
and the colors or blank impressions, for ornament,
all being impressed on it with great rapidity. The
completed cover, called a case, is then pasted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
sides of the book. A book thus bound has nothing
to hold cover and inside together save a strip of thin
muslin, with a strip of paper which goes over it,
passing from the back of the book to the inside of
the board covers. This strip grows weak after a
little use and frequently breaks, or pulls away from
the cover, or from the back, or from both. Books
printed on cheap paper and folded and sewed and
bound by machinery in the manner thus very briefly
outlined can be produced and sold at present for 10
cents each, or even less.</p>

<p>Books printed with more care, on better paper,
with a better quality of cloth on the cover, and a
more elaborate title in real gold instead of some
cheaper imitation of it, books, that is, like the novels
issued by the better class of publishers, can be produced
in quantities of from one to three thousand,
for from 15 to 30 cents each. Few of the novels put
on the market today cost the publishers, for their
making alone, as much as the latter price. To this
must be added a royalty to the author, generally
10% of the retail price, the cost of the management
of the business and the advertising. In the case of
small editions, one or two thousand, this brings the
original cost of the average work up to 50 or 75
cents. Suppose this book to be offered at retail at
$1.25. There must then be deducted from this retail
price the discount to the jobber, 25 to 40 +10%,
and the royalty, and the advertising, and the cost of
production, etc., leaving a profit to the publisher
of from 5 to 20 cents on each volume. A well-made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and widely advertised novel which does not sell
more than a thousand copies is not a very profitable
product for a publisher to put out.</p>

<p>The school text-books issued by the more reputable
publishing houses are generally very well made.
They are printed on good paper, usually rather
highly calendered, with good ink, are bound with
extra care, and have good material in their covers.
The competition between school book publishers
makes it necessary for them in self-defense to produce
books which will wear well in the hands of the
average pupil.</p>

<p>Up to a few years ago all books were sewn by hand,
the covers were made by hand, and hand work was
employed in putting book and cover together.</p>

<p>The process of sewing by hand may be briefly
described as follows: Two or more strings or tapes
are stretched between the edge of a board and a
stick held horizontally above it by two uprights.
The book folded and ready for sewing, after having
been either pressed or beaten with a hammer to
make it lie smooth, is held in a vise and two saw cuts
are made in the back at about the same distance
from each other and from the ends. Two smaller
saw cuts are also made in the back of the book, one
between each of the larger ones and the opposite
ends of the back. The first signature—the fold
or section made of a large sheet folded—of the
book is laid on the board so that the larger saw cuts
are opposite the two strings. A thread is passed
through the small cut at one end, into the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of the fold, then out again by the first string, around
the string, and in again to the middle of the fold,
then along the inside of the fold to the next string,
around that string, along inside the fold, then out
again at the other small cut. The second signature
is then laid on top of the first. The thread is passed
into the small cut, along and around the two strings,
as with the first signature, and out at the other
end, where it is tied to the end of the thread which
has been left sticking out of the first saw cut for
this purpose. This process is continued until the
book is all fastened together and to the strings. As
the sewing goes on, the several signatures are caught
together at the smaller holes at each end by passing
the thread, as it comes out of the hole, down and
under the loop made by the passing of the thread
between the two signatures previously sewn. In
the case of a book containing a large number of
signatures the thread does not extend the whole
length of each fold, but passes from one to another
as it goes the length of the book, gathering on two
signatures at once. Sometimes, by using four strings
instead of two, the string is made to pass through
and to sew on three signatures at a time. Examples
of this two-on and three-on method can be seen in
almost any large book bound prior to 15 or 20 years
ago. In very careful binding by hand in the early
days of book-making, the strings were not set into
saw cuts, but were simply laid across the back of
the book. The thread came out of the signature
and passed around the strings, and went in again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
The strings, with the thread thus wrapped around
them, made a welt across the back of the book.
These welts, when covered by the leather of the
binding, showed as raised bands. These raised
bands are imitated by pasting bits of leather on the
back in much so-called fine binding today. In some
cases the old process is employed and the bands
have a real reason for existence. Books are sometimes
sewn on tapes or strips of vellum. These,
laid across the back, sometimes make ridges which
are treated as bands in the completed book.</p>

<p>In old bindings, to give the book a better appearance
at top and bottom, what is called a headband
was put on with thread, the thread passing through
the signatures and from one signature to another in
such a way as still more securely to hold these
together. Today the headband is still used; but
usually it is simply pasted in and is little more than
an ornament. Sometimes the book’s back is still
further reinforced by pasting or gluing to it a piece
of vellum, leather or heavy cloth before the process
of putting on the cover begins.</p>

<p>Set rules for sewing books should not be laid down.
Each book is treated by the skillful binder, or should
be, in accordance with the character of its paper,
the number of inserts, the thickness of the paper,
the size of the signatures, the size of the leaves,
the use it is to receive, and other facts. The good
binder binds each book well according to its kind.</p>

<p>After the book is properly sewn, the strings on
which it is gathered are cut off a short distance from
the sides. Pieces of cardboard are cut of the proper
size for a cover. The ends of the strings are laced
into them or fastened down upon them with paste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
or glue. The leather for the cover is then pasted
or glued to the back and the outside of the boards.
The ends are turned over the boards and at the top
and bottom of the book are turned down and
pasted to themselves, thus forming a roll or crown
which lies up close to the headband. The sides are
then covered, if the book is not to be bound in full
leather, with cloth or paper or other material. The
outside sheets of the books, called end-sheets, are
then pasted to the inside of the cover and the book
is practically complete.</p>

<p>The back of the book is always covered with glue
after the sewing and before the leather or cloth is
put on. This glue is thin and hot, and is put on to
hold together the backs of the signatures. In rounding,
the binder manipulates the book with the hands,
and taps it with a hammer until the proper shape is
secured. This is done after the coat of glue has
been applied. In edition work this is done on a
machine. In backing the book is held between two
metal, or metal-edged, plates close up to the back,
the back having been stiffened previously with a
coat of glue which has not set very firmly; and with
a hammer the backs of the signatures are pounded
down and out, making a slight ledge or groove along
the outer edges against which set later the boards
of the covers.</p>

<p>If the book is to be tight back the cloth or leather
is glued direct to the backs of the signatures thus
rounded, though often a thin piece of cloth, super,
is first glued on, extending over onto the sides. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
it is to be loose back a double fold of paper is attached
to the back, one sheet to the back and one to the
cover material. The leather or cloth then stands out
from the book, when it is open, being attached to it
only at the joints. It is in loose back binding, as
said above, that cloth or leather is sometimes glued
fast and with great care to the back before the cover
goes on, thus taking the place of the leather of the
cover in the tight back book. In the best binding
this backing extends over through or past the joint
and onto the sides or covers; and is also firmly
attached, at the joint, to the leather of the back.
In the Newark library we use for this a thin soft
muslin of the best quality.</p>

<p>This description of the process of binding is a
suggestive outline only. Enough has been said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
however, to show that the books sewn by hand and
fastened carefully to the cover as described will, if
properly made, wear much longer than a book
bound by machinery, if bound as above described.
But, just as a machine properly handled can produce
paper of greater uniformity of thickness and
of a quality superior in many respects to the best
hand-made paper, so the machines used in binding
can, if properly handled, bind books even more
strongly than can any save the most careful workman.
The possible differences between machine-made
books can easily be noted in the cheap novels
of the day, which are poorly bound, and well-made
law books and encyclopædias. These latter are
often faithfully put together and will stand almost
as much wear as any books ever produced.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
  <span class="subhead">The Literary Side of Library Rebinding</span>
</h2>

<p>After satisfactory materials and methods of binding
for a library have been discovered and adopted,
there still remain many questions which can be well
answered only by one having a wide knowledge of
books. Nor is a general knowledge of books alone
enough to qualify one to answer wisely these questions.
Close acquaintance with the library’s policy
in regard to book-saving and book-buying and of
its attitude toward the demand for popular and
ephemeral fiction; knowledge of its reference work;
of the amount of handling its books receive by the
public, and of its financial condition and policy—all
this and much besides the person in charge of
binding should have before she can make wise
decisions. And particularly she needs knowledge of
paper, editions, prices and similar matters.</p>

<p>Take fiction for example. More than half of the
binding bills of most free public libraries are probably
chargeable to novels. One of these comes to
the hands of the person in charge of binding in such
condition that at the first glance it seems desirable
to rebind it. Let us suppose that it is still in publisher’s
cloth; is quite soiled outside, but still fairly
clean within; that the cover has parted from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
book in front; that several leaves are loose and two
of them frayed at the edges; that at the back the
outside sheets of several signatures are nearly worn
through or broken; and that the label is off. Should
it be rebound; or what should be done with it?
Before deciding its fate, questions like the following
must be answered.</p>

<p>If this is not the only copy of this book now in
the library, are the other copies in good condition?</p>

<p>If they are, can the library spare this copy because
the demand for this particular title is past? And is
it not better economy to throw it away or sell it—as
it will probably never be wanted again—than to
spend money in binding it?</p>

<p>That is to say, if it is bound, will it not stand
idle on the shelf?</p>

<p>If it continues to be somewhat popular, and this
copy would get some use if it were replaced, still, is
it a book the use of which it is the library’s policy to
encourage?</p>

<p>If not, has it not served its purpose and should it
not be put away, rather than entail on the library
another expense item in cost of binding?</p>

<p>If it is the only copy in the library, is it a book
the library wishes to retain or has it been in effect
on trial, and has proved not to be worth keeping?</p>

<p>If so, would not the binding of it be a use of money
far less justifiable than its original purchase?</p>

<p>Or is it perhaps of interest now simply as a part
of the history of fiction and so still worth keeping?</p>

<p>But, if kept for this purpose, does it need binding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
at all? Will not a little mending make it hold
together sufficiently well? Perhaps the best plan
would be to reclassify it for the literature section,
wrap it in paper, mark the wrapper, and put on the
shelf.</p>

<p>If it is a good book, in constant demand, the
question is still not a simple one. Is it on poor
paper, so poor that in our style of rebinding it will
last but a short time? If so, would not a new copy
be a better investment than the rebinding of this
one?</p>

<p>If the paper is good enough for rebinding, will it
stand mending and further wear without making its
ultimate binding very difficult?</p>

<p>If there are other editions of this book obtainable,
does this sample indicate that this particular edition
is the best one to buy hereafter?</p>

<p>These and many other questions confront the
librarian every time a book, of any kind, comes up
for binding. Because they are not wisely answered
the shelves of every library show examples of the
unwise expenditure of money. To take a specific
example in this same field of fiction. The library
has several sets of Cooper. In each of them is the
Chainbearer. Consider any one of the library’s
copies of this book: No one reads it. But mere
shifting on the shelf gradually wears it out. It goes
through the bindery, and, being by Cooper, and a
novel, it is bound, in the same style as the Spy which
happens to go with it, in half leather. The Spy is
used; the leather on it keeps soft and pliable and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
wears a year or two, until the book is too dirty to
keep it longer. But the Chainbearer stands untouched
and its leather hardens and breaks. It
must be bound again within three or four years,
even though it has not been lent once in that period.
If it had received a plain cloth binding, that binding
would have cost less and lasted indefinitely. If
it had been thrown away the library would have
been the gainer.</p>

<p>The problem is not less complex when books in
classes other than fiction are up for consideration.
Many of them are rarely used; why rebind them at
all, no matter how broken? To tie a string about
them or to wrap in paper and mark them would often
be wiser economy. Often they are single volumes
from long sets, an edition, for example, of some
history bound about 1800. The binding is calf. In
rebinding, to match the set is very unwise, for all
calf now on the market will rot in a few years. It
must be bound, let us suppose, as it is occasionally
called for; yet it will not, like a popular novel, wear
out or become unbearably dirty in a half century.</p>

<p>Shall it be put in morocco? This would be a
mistake, for it is doubtful if present-day morocco
will last 50 years, probably not half that time. The
only alternative is cloth, and that with no leather
title label on the back. One of the best things is,
for a large book, heavy duck back, light gray or light
green, lettered in printers’ ink, with sides of any
good book cloth. This spoils the looks of the set.
Moreover, the cloth catches dust and dirt, and grows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
soft and flabby. But it is today one of the few safe
bindings. If the book is small, full art canvas or
imperial morocco cloth is better.</p>

<p>So, as I have said, paper, leather, cloth, sewing,
joints, gold, and many other things the librarian must
know; and to these must add knowledge of literary
values, popularity of books and authors, editions,
prices and a score of other things before he can be
sure, if he ever can be sure, that he is really binding
economically, in the long run.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
  <span class="subhead">Binding Materials Suitable for a Library</span>
</h2>

<p>The Newark Library has tried many experiments
in the choice of materials. It finds that thin, imported,
acid-free pigskin, first used in this country
by Mr. Chivers, is the best material for backs. It
wears well; does not rot; is easily manipulated and
takes gold lettering well. A disadvantage is its
tendency to darken with handling. It works well
on books of all sizes and all kinds, whether they are
handled much or not.</p>

<p>Morocco, if tanned so that it will not rot, is more
expensive than pigskin. For the finer books it is
better than pigskin as it preserves better its appearance
under much handling.</p>

<p>Cowskin is good for books which are to be much
handled and are likely to be worn out and discarded
within five years. Only the best quality should be
used. Dark red is usually preferable to light red or
brown. It costs less than pigskin.</p>

<p>English Imperial Morocco cloth makes a good full
binding for books that are not to receive much wear.
It cannot be lettered easily, and if much handled
soon looks dingy at the top and bottom of the back
and along the joint and at the corners.</p>

<p>Dark blue art canvas, the kind in which both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
warp and woof are dyed blue, makes a serviceable
and inexpensive full binding. It can be recommended
for books which are to be handled but
little.</p>

<p>Large volumes like periodicals and society proceedings
should have backs of gray or light green
duck, with black letters, and sides of art canvas or
morocco cloth.</p>

<p>Newspapers should also have backs of duck. The
sides may be covered with paper, but art canvas or
art vellum is better.</p>

<p>If newspapers are to be consulted often they
should be carefully bound of course. But in a great
many libraries it is wise to tie most newspapers up in
flat packages instead of binding them.</p>

<p>For the sides of books, bound with pigskin or
morocco backs, which are to be much handled the
Newark Library has found nothing as good as keratol,
elsewhere described. For books which are not
to be much handled, morocco cloth is excellent.
On books which are bound with an eye to their
beauty,—curios, rarities, books to be exhibited,
etc.—Newark uses three-fourths morocco with sides
of paper or of cloth of appropriate color.</p>

<p>The joint committee on printing of the House of
Representatives, Washington, D. C., made an investigation
in 1907 of several binding materials. This
investigation was made with special reference to the
binding of the publications of the United States
government. It included the subjects of endurance,
wear, tensile strength, tendency to absorb moisture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
readiness with which attacked by insects. Incidentally
other qualities were considered.</p>

<p>An outcome of this investigation was the publication
by the Bureau of Standards, Washington, of
specifications for bookcloth for binding depository
sets of public documents. The specifications state
that the cloth shall be from first quality staple cotton,
uniformly woven and of the grade known as
firsts. The surface shall be smooth and hard and
show no tendency to stick when folded upon itself.
Further specifications cover the strength of the
material, its tendency to absorb moisture, its resistance
to mold and insects and other characteristics.</p>

<p>These specifications may be used by all librarians
in selecting cloth for ordinary library binding. The
Bureau of Standards will make tests according to
the specifications for any library, charging a fee for
the work. The cloth which conforms to these specifications
is a smooth cotton fabric similar to that
used by the best law book publishers in this country,
and to the duck mentioned above. It is much
heavier than ordinary publisher’s book cloth.</p>

  <span class="subhead">Rebinding for Libraries</span>
</h2>

<p>Libraries differ as to bindings in their needs and
in their possibilities. Books differ even more. No
library can or should exactly follow any one style
in its rebinding work. I add, however, the following
directions for ordinary, much-used 12mo volumes,
in the hope that they may be found suggestive. They
should be read in the light of all the rest of this book,
and not taken as final authority at any point.</p>

<p>Pull apart with great care. Remove all threads
and old paste and glue. Smooth out the backs by
beating. Guard the outer and inner leaves of all
signatures that are broken or weak with paper or
jaconet.</p>

<p>Loose pictures, if they are to be kept, put in with
guards. Frequently in rebinding the illustrations
may be dropped with no loss either to the reader’s
pleasure or the cause of art.</p>

<p>See that the leaves are all in and complete.</p>

<p>No. 1. Books sewed regularly, that is, not whipstitched.
Guard the first and last signatures with
jaconet. If the title-page or frontispiece is an insert,
paste the guard along the insert and over the first
signature. This saves the labor of guarding the
insert and first signature separately.</p>

<p>Guard with jaconet the inner side of the inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
leaf of every signature that is at all worn or weak;
if badly worn guard also the outer side of the outside
leaf. In some cases every leaf should be guarded.
But remember that guards thicken the back.</p>

<p>Make two sets of four-page end-sheets by folding
once with the grain pieces of lithographed lining
paper; and two sets of waste papers by folding once
pieces of good book paper, about 60 lb. Guard the
outside of the folds of all of these with jaconet, and
place one of each kind at the front and back of the
book, the lithograph one on the outside in each case.</p>

<p>Use Hayes’s standard linen thread of a weight
adapted to the book. The cotton thread used in
book sewing machines wears well, but is not recommended
for hand-work. No. 25 is good for books
with light sections, 16 for those with heavy sections,
and 20 for those with medium. Sew the book on
four stout but flexible tapes, each about a quarter
of an inch wide. Sew all along throughout.</p>

<p>Leave about three-fourths of an inch of tape projecting
each side when cutting off.</p>

<p>From here on the process is very similar for this
kind of binding sewed in the ordinary way, and for
No. 2, whipstitched, which follows.</p>

<p>No. 2. Books which are whipstitched, being in
such condition or of such character that they have
to be trimmed at the back, being then simply piles
of loose sheets.</p>

<p>Cut off as little of the backs as possible. Prepare
and place end sheets and waste papers as above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
described, except here paste the jaconet guard only
along one side, the outer, of the folds of all of them.
This gives firm hold for first overcast stitches.</p>

<p>Glue the back of the book slightly so that it may
be divided into signatures of a few leaves each which
will hold together.</p>

<p>Sew on same tapes as for a regularly sewed book.</p>

<p>In overcasting or whipstitching do not take up
more than one-eighth of an inch for the deepest
stitches. Make the signatures small and pass the
needle through two of them with each stitch, taking
the stitch diagonally.</p>

<p>Paste the lining papers to the waste sheets, all
over, front and back. Paste ends of tapes on top
of lining papers. Trim the book, cutting it as little
as possible.</p>

<p>Glue the back slightly, and, when it is partly
dried, round the book and then back it. In backing
do not break the threads or pull them through
the paper. This is especially to be guarded against
on whipstitched books.</p>

<p>After rounding and backing, glue to the back and
over onto the sides, passing beyond the jaconet guards,
a strip of medium weight, soft, bleached muslin.</p>

<p>Measure and cut the boards, which should be of
good quality, adapted to the wear the book is likely
to have.</p>

<p>Cut the leather back, of pigskin. Do not pare
it save slightly at the edges. Put a little paste on
the boards to make them stay in place, and set them
in place on the book.</p>

<p>Put on the leather, leaving the boards in place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
tucking the leather in at top and bottom,—head
and tail.</p>

<p>When the leather is partly dried, the book having
been kept under slight pressure, cover the boards
with keratol or appropriate cloth. Make the corner
fold by first turning the cover material in straight
across the corner and then bringing in the folds
from right and left.</p>

<p>Paste the end sheets firmly down on the inside of
the covers. This fastens the book securely into its
case. Press until thoroughly dry.</p>

<p>Letter in gold with large, rather heavy, black-face
letters. Reduce the lettering to as few words as
possible.</p>

<p>No rule can be given as to the glue to be used.
Let your binder be sure that what he uses is good,
whether the price he pays be high or low. He can
tell whether it is good or not by testing it. Glue pots
should be cleaned out frequently. Glue should be
treated with judgment as to heat and degree of
thickness at which it is used. It is animal matter
that quickly changes its character and loses its
strength under wrong conditions.</p>

<p>The boards to be used in a book should depend,
as to quality and thickness, on the character of the
volume they cover. Expensive boards on a book
which will probably soon be too dirty to be kept, are
not essential.</p>

<p>Neither strings nor tapes need to be laced into
the boards on ordinary library work. They hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
well if carefully glued down on the inside, and very
well if pasted between two boards or into a split
in one.</p>

<p>Music should be sewed regularly or all along and
the inside and outside sheets of all signatures should
be guarded with jaconet. This guarding of the inner
sheets makes the binding stronger, as the inner
pages of a section always tend to work loose if much
handled. The side and top squares should be about
⅛ of an inch; but the bottom square about ⅜ inch.
This large square at the bottom raises the book on

as the pages frequently catch when the squares are
the usual size all around. Newark finds half pig

<p>Large maps, drawings, etc., may be mounted on
linen, jaconet, nainsook, ordinary bleached, or
unbleached muslin. The material used should be
five or six inches larger all around than the map to
be mounted for convenience in stretching and working.
Tack the cloth on a clean board, table or floor.
Put the tacks very close together and tack the selvage
edge first. The surface may be covered with waste
paper before stretching the cloth on it. Apply a
thin coat of thin paste all over. When dry, paste
the map and allow it to stand about ten minutes to
give it time to stretch. Lay the map on the muslin
and rub it down under a stout piece of paper. Thorough
rubbing down is absolutely necessary to make
every part adhere. Proceed from the center outward,
carefully rubbing out creases and bubbles. Dry
thoroughly before taking up.</p>

  <span class="subhead">Lettering and Numbering the Backs of Books</span>
</h2>

<p>Several methods of lettering the backs of books
are in use in libraries. The best is gilding. If this
is well done with genuine gold it will remain bright
for many years, and will stand hard wear better
than any other style of marking. On leather this
method should always be followed. Only the best
work in gilding is worth the money it costs, and there
is no substitute for gold that deserves mention.</p>

<p>Gilding on cloth by hand is rather difficult. It
does not show well on light-colored cloth, or on some
dark colors. On some cloths, also, gold titles become
quite invisible in certain lights, probably because
of a certain combination in them of color and texture.
Dark green is often quite objectionable on this
account, and the same is true of some shades of red,
in cloths of a certain texture. This difficulty should
be noted, and only those cloths used on books which
are to have gold titles on which the letters show
well, at whatever angle the light may strike them.</p>

<p>The process of gilding is described in books on
binding. It costs usually about two cents a line.</p>

<p>Black ink is very good for lettering on some kinds
of cloth, particularly on light-colored duck, canvas,
buckram, whether cotton or linen, and art vellum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
The ink used should be “bookbinder’s title ink,”
made for the purpose. The letters should be large
and heavy-faced and not set very closely together.
The method of applying the ink is to pour some of
it on a piece of marble and then to apply to the type
with a rubber pad. As the type is cold, considerable
pressure is necessary to make the ink take well.
Black lettering costs about the same as gilding, say,
two cents per line.</p>

<p>Letters in gold are sometimes applied to books
bound in cloth by printing them on a very thin piece
of leather and then gluing the latter to the back.
This method is also occasionally used on books in
leather. These leather labels can be stamped by
machinery in quantities, as is done for large editions
by commercial binders, though this is not practicable
for the ordinary library binder. They usually look
very well when first applied; but it is not very easy
to make them hold permanently.</p>

<p>The better method in almost all cases is to letter
directly on the book, no matter what material it is
bound in.</p>

<p>The binder should use brass type letters in most
cases; they wear well and give a clear impression.
Ordinary printer’s type will do excellent work for
a time. Brass type costs from 10 to 20 cents per
letter, common type from one to five dollars per
font, according to size and number of types. The
best style for ordinary use is condensed gothic. A
heavy-faced Roman, like Jensen, is sometimes good,
and on larger books looks very well in capitals and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
small letters. Use as large letters as the back of
the book will permit. Reduce the number of words
in all titles to the lowest possible number.</p>

on the backs of books:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Titles can be printed on paper also and the paper
then pasted or glued on. This plan is not at all
satisfactory for books which are to have much use,
as the paper soon gets soiled and is very apt to peel off.</p>

<p>Many libraries have bound books in light-colored
cloth, usually art vellum, and then lettered them by
hand with india-ink. The result is not very satisfactory.
The time taken in lettering them neatly is
considerable; the letters soon get soiled and illegible,
and even if very well done they look cheap and homemade.
At the ordinary cost of gilding, about two
cents per line, hand lettering is almost as expensive
as gilding if the cost of the time spent on it is fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
estimated. Then, to make them legible, the cloth
chosen must be so light in color that it soon shows
the results of handling and becomes dingy and disreputable.
A dark cloth of the best quality and
gold letters pay best.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="center bold">Type Cabinet</p>

</div>

<p>On books bound in dark cloth or leather, numbers
can be written in white ink. Some librarians find
this plan quite satisfactory. The method is this:
The place for the number being located, wash the
varnish away from it with a clean cloth, dampened
with a mixture of ammonia one part and water two
parts, and allow to dry. Then write the letters
with a fine camel’s hair brush, about No. 2 in size.
When thoroughly dry give the letters a thin coat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of shellac. David’s white letterine is one of the
best white inks. White ink is difficult to manage
and wears off soon if not very carefully put on.</p>

<p>Labels should always be put at least four inches
from the bottom of the back, the tail, that they
may not be soiled or worn off in handling. They
should be marked with india-ink in large, plain figures.
On many books it will pay to have them gilded, as
when thus put on they do not detract from the
book’s appearance and look well for an indefinite
time. If labels are used, put them on as follows:
The place for the label being located, wash away
the varnish from that place a little with a clean
cloth dampened with water and ammonia. If the
book is thin cut the label before it is put on, so
that it does not quite reach the edges of the back.
If the book is so thin that there would not be sufficient
room for the book number on a label cut to fit
it, place the label on the upper left corner of the
front cover. Press the label tightly and evenly down
until it sticks firmly all over. This is most important.
Use Dennison’s round gummed labels. These, being
round, present no corners to be easily ruffed up.
They are free from lines around the border, so their
whole surface is available for the book number.
They can be had in several sizes.</p>

<p>Lay out a scheme for marking books, and then
make model labels to be followed in marking fiction,
classed books, reference books, juveniles, magazines,
etc., so that the same kinds of combinations of letters
and figures will always be written in the same way.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
  <span class="subhead">Pamphlets</span>
</h2>

<p>The subject of the care of pamphlets in a library
does not come within the field of these notes; but it
may be proper to say that experience and observation
have led me to the conclusion that many pamphlets
are bound and entered in the catalog which
are not worth the labor they have entailed. How
those should be kept that are thought worth keeping
I do not attempt to say. Often those kept are
not worth keeping, and still oftener those bound
and catalogued are not worth binding. If they are
bound, the style of binding they should receive, if
they are in fact books in paper covers, is to be decided
by the same rules as is the same question in regard
to other books. If they are in fact pamphlets—a
few pages with no cover, and must stand on the
shelf and will be little used, a cheap binding may be
made thus: Take off the cover; fold once a sheet
of stout paper to the pamphlet’s size; cut two boards
for covers, a little narrower than the pamphlet;
paste them to the paper mentioned about half
an inch apart; paste a strip of book cloth down
the back and over the edges of the boards; paste
the cover to the boards, front and back; sew the
pamphlet into the case thus roughly made with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
stout thread through three or five holes along the
back (this last process is called stabbing); trim.
This is simple, strong and inexpensive.</p>

<p>If the pamphlet consists of one signature only the
method just described can be followed; but the sewing
should be through the back, a saddlestitch, with
the knot inside. The binder’s knot or stitch is thus
made: Having three holes for the thread, go first
down through the center one, back through one of
the end holes, down again through the other end
hole, up through the center, and tie the two ends
over the thread which passes from end hole to end
hole. With five holes the process is similar and
easily followed.</p>

<p>A very neat pamphlet binding, for pamphlets too
large to be saddle-stitched, is the following:</p>

<p>Cut two pieces of smooth, hard, “flat” paper the
size of the pamphlet; along one edge of each paste a
strip of thin cotton cloth, bleached muslin, about half
an inch wide; lay one piece each side of the pamphlet,
cloth strips at the back, and sew the pamphlet through
these strips, close to the back, with three holes or
five as seems advisable. Make two end-sheets of two
leaves each, the size of the pamphlet; guard each
with muslin; paste these to the first sheets, all over,
one on each side of the pamphlet; cut boards and
paste them down on the outer halves of the end-sheets
(each end-sheet has now become, one-half the
lining paper for the cover, the other half, half of a
double fly leaf); put on a back of art vellum, leather
or other material; paste on the pamphlet’s cover;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
trim. This binding is very strong, very neat, opens
quite easily and will wear well. The boards can be
covered all over with cloth, and the binding will
then wear much longer.</p>

<p>Ballard’s clips find favor with many librarians, for
both pamphlets and magazines. They hold things
together neatly and securely, and hold magazines
into covers of cloth or leather quite effectively.
They are strips of sheet steel, of several widths, bent
into about three-fourths of a circle. Small steel
levers fit into cleverly adjusted holes and make
opening easy.</p>

  <span class="subhead">Magazine Binders</span>
</h2>

<p>It has long been one of the library traditions that
magazines used in the reading room should be put
into stiff and heavy temporary binders as soon as
received, and so arranged, usually on racks holding
them vertically, that they can all be seen at once.
It is now permitted to doubt the wisdom of this
proceeding. The binders are expensive; the best
of them soon get a worn and dingy look, even if they
hold together for a long time; the racks with their
contents are usually not ornamental and are often
quite the reverse. The space taken by the racks can
ill be spared, especially when the area needed by
browsers in front of them is included. If the number
of periodicals taken is quite large the display
space needed for them is quite out of proportion to
the use made of them. Recent back numbers of
most journals, as well as the last numbers, should
be made accessible to readers, and for this there is
no provision in the vertical file arrangement. There
seems no better reason for exposing to the casual
reader of the reading room the full fronts of all the
journals the library takes than there is for making
a similar display of all the books the library buys.</p>

<p>To the display of all journals on terrace tables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
most of the objections just noted are also applicable.
A careful consideration of the relative value of current
numbers of periodicals in a library and of space,
time and energy that should be put on their presentation
to the public, will lead one to the conclusion
that the best way to handle them is to lay them in
alphabetical order on plainly labeled ordinary book
shelves wide enough to hold the larger ones, set about
six inches apart, that the numbers for the past six
months may be kept together.</p>

<p>The thin journals which are most read, like “Puck”
or the “Scientific American,” may well be slipped
for a week into an inexpensive binder like the one
called “Cleveland” in the list which follows. Magazines
much read, like the “Century” and “McClures,”
can be so reinforced in a few minutes, as described
below, that they will keep quite neat for several
months.</p>

<p>This method is economical of space; keeps the
journals easily in one alphabetical series; makes
six numbers accessible instead of one; eliminates
the question of binders; saves the assistant’s time,
relatively to the service given to the public; and asks
the public simply to remember their alphabet and
to read the shelves.</p>

<p>Binders that require the punching of holes through
the backs of magazines should be looked on with
suspicion; though in spite of its expense the binder
of this type, with flexible metal strips in place of
strings and with polished sides containing actual
covers of the magazine within, has had much use.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
It wears well, is put on about as quickly as any,
exposes the date and name along the magazine’s
back, and looks more attractive than any other
binder when perched in rows in vertical racks.</p>

<p>All other binders may be divided into three kinds:
The Clip, the Bar and the String.</p>

<p>The Clip is based on the Ballard clip idea. The
Johnston is a good example. A spring in the back
grips the sides of the magazine and holds the binder
on. It tends to make a magazine less easy to hold
open. It pleases a good many.</p>

<p>The Bar has for its main feature one or more
strips of steel, which run down the back of the magazine
and are fastened to the binder by a hinge at
one end and a hook at the other. Of all of this
kind the best for the money is, perhaps, the New
Haven.</p>

<p>The String uses a string or elastic band to hold the
magazine. In the one called the Springfield, first
used in Los Angeles in 1890, the string passes through
the magazine, between sections, and through three
holes in the back of the binder in a binder’s stitch.</p>

<p>The Newark Library has tried many kinds of
material for binders. Thin book cloth soon wears
out. Heavy and strong cloth soon gets soiled.
Full leather is very expensive, unless the leather
used is light and poor, and then it soon wears out.
Good leather backs outwear sides of any cloth. A
Cleveland binder made for “Harper’s Weekly,” with
heavy cowskin back and keratol sides, was in constant
use for 30 months and looked well nearly all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
that time. It costs 70 cents. The few binders now
used in the Newark reading room are made in this
style.</p>

<p>Covers of strong paper pasted to the outsides of
single copies of magazines to protect them during
reading-room use or for lending, the Newark Library has
not found satisfactory. We reinforce the covers
of single magazines for this purpose as follows and
find the method quite satisfactory:</p>

<p>If the original cover is loose, take it off and paste
on again carefully. Line the cover with thin, white
bond paper, pasted on all over and lapping a half-inch
onto the magazine itself. Press for ten minutes
in a copying press. Paste a strip of thin dark-colored
book cloth down the back on the outside.
Put under moderate pressure until dry. Write the
name and date of the magazine on the strip of cloth
with white ink.</p>

<p>Sew large magazines like the “Ladies’ Home
Journal” into covers of stout paper. A strip of
paper an inch and a half wide placed in the center
of the section through which the magazine is sewed
keeps the sewing from tearing the paper.</p>

<p>Single copies of magazines can be bound for lending,
at about 15 cents each, in this manner: Take
off covers; trim; remove table of contents if it faces
the cover; paste strip of strong cotton cloth down
the back, and extending about an inch over the
sides; staple this on with at least three staples in
the same line with the staples which hold the magazine
together, or sew with stout thread through five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
holes; cut covers as for an ordinary binding; paste
them to the strip; cover all over with art vellum;
line covers with paper (this lining can be put on
all over as the first step in the process, and pasted
to the covers after they are on, thus forming the end
paper); paste the front cover of the magazine on
the front in such a way that the date line down the
back comes on the back of the new cover. This
is neat, convenient and quite durable.</p>

<p>A few of the more popular binders are listed below.
The material used to cover them can be endlessly
varied.</p>

<p>1. The New Haven Binder, designed by Mr. W. K.
Stetson, Librarian of the Public Library of New
Haven. A solid back of metal. A metal rod hinged
at one end passes through the middle section of
the magazine. The free end of the rod is formed
into a hook which, being slipped under a metal
loop attached to the back of the binder, holds the
magazine firmly in place. Costs from 85 cents
to $1.15. A simpler binder, also designed by Mr.
Stetson and made on the same principles, sells at
55 cents.</p>

<p>2. The Johnston Binder, made by William G.
Johnston &amp; Co., Pittsburgh, Pa., has a round steel
spring back which grips the magazine. Costs from
75 cents up, according to size.</p>

<p>3. The Boston Binder, made by the Office, Bank
and Library Co., 157 Summer St., Boston. A rounded
wooden back supports the binding device which consists
of two bars of steel pivoted at one end and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
fastened at the other with a pin. Costs from 75
cents to $2.00 according to size and material used.</p>

<p>4. The Torsion Binder, made by the Barrett
Bindery Co., 180–182 Monroe St., Chicago. Two flat
steel wires are hinged to the binder at the top and
fitted with knobs at the free ends. These pass inside
the magazine and a slight pressure on the knobs
sends the free ends of the wires into an inclined slot.
Costs from 95 cents to $4.50 according to size and
material used.</p>

<p>5. The Springfield Binder has a strip down the
back of a simple cover or case, with three holes
punched therein through which the magazine is laced
in by strings. Shoe strings or tape may be used.
Costs from 25 cents up.</p>

<p>6. The Chivers Binder, made by Cedric Chivers,
Bath, England, and Brooklyn, N. Y., is like the
Springfield cover, but with a separate flat brass rod
around which the magazine is sewed into the
cover.</p>

<p>7. The Weis Binder, made by the Weis Co., Toledo,
Ohio, has metal grooves in the back which hold the
magazine.</p>

<p>8. The Buchan Binder, made by Buchan Mfg. Co.,
Newark, N. J., has a steel back which consists of a
hinge regulated by a screw. One or more magazines
may be kept in the binder. Good for magazines that
are poorly put together.</p>

<p>9. The Roedde Magazine Binder, made by the
Flexible Back Looseleaf Ledger Co., Buffalo, N. Y.,
varies somewhat from the Torsion and Boston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Binders, but is built on the same principle. Costs
from $1.10 to $8.00.</p>

<p>10. Cleveland Binder, so called because much
used in the Cleveland Library. A simple cover or
case in the back of which are holes half an inch from
the top and bottom; through these a piece of narrow
elastic is sewed. The magazine, opened at the
middle of a section is slipped under the elastic.
Recommended for weekly journals.</p>

<p>11. Klip Binder, made by H. H. Ballard, Pittsfield,
Mass. A simple cover attached to the magazine
by a pair of steel clips, put on with keys. Price
of klips, 50 cents per box of 10.</p>

<p>12. The Philadelphia Binder, made by G. D.
Emerson, Philadelphia, Pa. A rod passes through
the magazine and springs into hooks at each end
of the back.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
  <span class="subhead">Repairing Books, General Rules</span>
</h2>

<p>The universal rule in this matter is, don’t. To
this there are exceptions; but many if not most of
the books which are repaired are so injured by the
process itself, or by the wear they receive after they
are repaired, that it would have been better for
them if they had not been repaired at all, but sent
direct to the binder.</p>

<p>Librarians do not pay sufficient attention to book
surgery.</p>

<p>All repairing of books should be done by skilled
persons. The question of whether or not repairs
shall be made at all should be decided by a person
who has not only technical skill in repairing; but
also knowledge of the use to which the book in hand
is likely to be subjected. This, because in many
cases it will be evident to a person who knows about
the use the books are to have that certain of them
should not be repaired at all, no matter if in quite
a dilapidated condition, with loose covers and loose
leaves; but should be neatly wrapped in good manila
paper, labeled plainly on the back and set again on
the shelf. The few times in a year when little-used
books are wanted do not, in many cases, warrant
their rebinding. Repairs on them, no matter how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
well done, are likely to injure them. Books which
are rarely borrowed, even though they are used
occasionally, or are even a good deal handled because
they stand near books which are much used, should
perhaps be mended a little; loose leaves should be
tipped in, at least. But work on them beyond that
is often injurious.</p>

<p>The feeling that all books in a library should be
neatly bound has caused much unnecessary expense.</p>

<p>In most libraries of moderate size and in all large
ones, there should be a supervisor of binding and
repairs; a person thoroughly familiar with the whole
routine of library work, familiar also with literature,
keeping close watch of the rise and fall in popularity
of new books. Such a person could say, for example,
that the library’s third copy of the Valley of Decision
and the fourth copy of the Crisis, if ready for repairing
or rebinding, could with good economy be placed
on a reserve shelf, not accessible to the public, there
to be held until the delivery desk assistants find a
call for them. That is, she would know that with
two or three copies in good condition of these books
in circulation there would almost always be one in
the library. When the library’s stock of such books
as those named becomes reduced to one sound copy
she can then tell, from the demand for it, if it is
wise to bind one copy, or all; or if it is wise to do
more than mend.</p>

<p>This omniscient person who has charge of binding
and repairs, reports to the head of the library that
such and such books are past repairs; that they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
cost 35 to 50 cents apiece to be properly rebound,
and asks, “Will the library ever want them again?”
If not, then she will advise that they be given away
and their cards removed from the catalog. Or, if
they must be kept for historical or religious or
superstitious or other reasons she will advise that
they be neatly tied up in paper, labeled, and put
back on the shelf.</p>

<p>Knowledge of the art of mending implies not only
knowledge of the process of making a book by
machinery and by hand; but also knowledge of the
different kinds of paper, how they wear, if they
break easily, if they will soon grow brittle, and the
effect on them of attempts to hold them with paste
or glue.</p>

<p>Along with this knowledge should also go knowledge
of the cost of each individual book, and such
knowledge of their use as will enable the repairer to
decide at once whether 10, 20, or 30 cents spent in
repairs will or will not pay.</p>

<p>As long as there are so few assistants who are at
all familiar with paper, type, binding, literary quality,
popularity, cost, etc., it is well to discourage almost
all book repairs.</p>

<p>As soon as we admit, as we must, that a good
book, costing from one to two dollars, must be
mended carefully if at all, we have opened the door
for a large expense. An assistant can easily spend
an hour or two on a book, repairing its cover, mending
a few leaves and putting it in order. When she
gets through she will have put from 30 to 50 cents’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
worth of time into it, has probably permanently
injured it, and in a few months or years it will be
in worse condition than if she had never touched
it at all. Moreover, the same amount of money
put out in cash instead of time would in many cases
have rebound it.</p>

<p>In a measure the remarks just made apply even
to popular books, much used by children or adults.
It is easy to spend more money in mending them
than good economy can justify. Mend sparingly;
rebind early.</p>

<p>The reason for this warning against mending lies
in the anatomy of the book and the injury it receives
from handling after it begins to break up, and especially
after its first breaks have been mended by a
prentice hand.</p>

<p>The weakest point in a book is the joint. In
publishers’ binding of today this joint is made by
a piece of super, which is glued to the back of the
book and then to the inside of the cover, plus the
end paper which is pasted over it and also onto the
cover. This super is weak. If it is put on with a
poor glue that glue soon grows hard and the joint
is further weakened thereby. It breaks or tears
easily. Also, it parts easily from the back to which
it is glued and from the cover. No strings or tapes
pass from the book to cover. When the joint once
comes loose from either back or cover, or breaks,
it cannot well be either attached or mended again.
It is sometimes possible to take a broken book out
of its case entirely, remove the old and attach new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
super, add new end sheets, put it again into the
case and get considerable use from it. But any
other kind of mending of the joint is almost futile
and even this is injurious. And the better such
mending seems at first to succeed, the greater the
harm it is really doing to the whole book. For the
mending usually consists in pasting a strip of strong
paper or cloth along the joint. This simply conveys
the strain from the joint proper, where it belongs,
to the first leaf of the first signature. This
is only paper, usually poor at that. It soon breaks
and lets its other half loose. Very commonly other
injuries are worked at the same time. The book
gets loose again, if it was ever really tightened. The
super with hard glue attached rubs about on the
backs of the signatures; several of them are cut
through, and the possibility of a rebinding with
proper sewing is either gone forever or can be
regained only after the long labor of mending many
signatures.</p>

<p>When the cords or bands are broken in a book
in which they are used it is as useless to attempt
to fasten book and cover together as it is when the
super gives way in publishers’ binding.</p>

<p>Loose leaves appear earliest in books printed on
paper which is so heavy that it breaks almost as
soon as it is folded. If the loose leaves of such
books are tipped in they tend to tear out with them
the ones they are tipped onto. Leaves should rarely
be tipped into books which have never been rebound.
In rebound books which are in their last days and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
will never be rebound again it is sometimes proper
to tip in.</p>

<p>Full-page illustrations which come loose can in
most cases be left out to advantage. To tip them
in again hurts the leaves they are fastened to. They
are usually so poor that it is a kindness to the reader
to throw them away.</p>

<p>In the long run a book needing more than very
slight repairs will give better return if so rebound
at once that it will hang together until so dirty
that it will have to be thrown away.</p>

<p>Some books, especially some of those printed on
cheap, heavy, coated paper, will never pay to rebind.
They should be mended, each according to its constitution,
and when beyond mending thrown away.</p>

<p>Good general rules for mending books are few.
The first and most important of all is: Be sparing
with paste or other stickist. Another is: If a machine-bound
book is broken at the joint, the cover beginning
to part from the back, send it straight to the binder.</p>

<p>The best plan is to buy your books as far as possible
properly bound for library use direct from the
publishers’ sheets. Such books never need mending
or rebinding. Being flexible and easily opened
their leaves are rarely torn; and, for the same reason,
getting no hard pressure from moist or dirty hands
in trying to keep them open, their leaves keep clean
for a long time.</p>

<p>Books not thus bound in the first place should
be rebound in first-class manner when they begin
to break. Parsimony in rebinding is a library thief.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
  <span class="subhead">Repairing Books, Newark Methods</span>
</h2>

<p>Books are sent to the bindery and repair department
from the delivery department, as the head of
the latter department may direct; and the head of
the bindery department, or some one under her
direction, is constantly looking over the shelves for
books that need attention.</p>

<p>In the repair department, which attends to the
repair of books and to the sending of those needing
binding to the bindery, these directions are followed:</p>

<p>When a book looks dilapidated, note carefully its
condition throughout. Consider these questions in
regard to it: Is it worth repairing? Should it be
covered? Should it be rebound? Should it be discarded?
No general rules can be given by which to
answer these queries. Each case must be decided
by itself.</p>

<p><dfn>General cleaning.</dfn> Look through book; turn out
corners of leaves which have been turned in; mend
torn leaves with transparent mending paper, or
Japanese mending tissue; erase dirt and pencil marks.</p>

<p><dfn>Pencil marks.</dfn> For removing soil and pencil marks,
we have tried the Ruby, Cerise, and Ideal erasers,
Art gum, and ivory soap and water. We like the
Cerise, manufactured by Eberhard Faber, as having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
more grit than the Ruby and yet not injurious to
the paper.</p>

<p><dfn>Torn leaves.</dfn> Ordinary circulating books are best
mended with narrow strips of Japanese tissue and
paste. This is cheaper than commercial gummed
paper and is preferable to it also, as the mucilage
on the latter grows dark and brittle in a short time.
Dennison’s adhesive tape costs about three cents
for a roll of four yards, while one sheet of Japanese
tissue, costing two and a quarter cents, cuts into 46
yards of strips the width of Dennison’s.</p>

<p>Torn leaves in choice books may thus be mended:
Match the edges of the tear carefully and apply a
narrow line of paste along them. Lay over this a
piece of Japanese tissue larger than the tear, and rub
it down very lightly. Repeat this on the other side
of the leaf and put under moderate pressure. When
dry, pull off all the tissue that will come away easily.</p>

<p><dfn>Cleaning publishers’ bindings.</dfn> Often there are a
few spots on books which make them unsightly.
It is not advisable to wash a cloth cover, unless very
dirty, as the finish is thereby removed, thus permitting
the book to become soiled again almost
with first handling. In case, however, a publisher’s
cloth binding has become so soiled as to need washing,
it can be very well cleaned and given a new finish
by the process described below. If the directions
are carefully followed books treated in this way will
look almost new and will keep clean almost as well
as they did when they came from the publishers’
hands:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Hold the book by the leaves in the left hand, with
the covers outside of fingers and thumb; rub the
cover gently with a sponge dipped in a mixture of
vinegar and water, half of each. Continue to rub
it carefully until it is quite clean; but do not press
hard enough or rub persistently enough to take off
any of the color. Rub gently, slowly and carefully,
letting the vinegar and water do most of the work.
When thoroughly clean, or as clean as the character
of color and cloth will permit the book in hand to be
made, stand it on end to dry. The drying will take
at least a half hour; a good plan, consequently, is
to clean as many books at one time as one can do
in about forty-five minutes. The first one cleaned
will then be ready for the next step when the whole
lot has been finished.</p>

<p>In a common drinking glass, place one teaspoonful
of egg albumen, to be had at any book bindery, and
two teaspoonfuls of vinegar, add half a glass of water
and let this stand over night. The next day, add
two teaspoonfuls of binders’ paste, stir thoroughly,
and it is ready for use. With a sponge give the
cleaned books one coat of this mixture and again
stand on end to dry. This mixture will not make
the covers as shiny as does shellac or varnish, but will
cover the surface well and protect it. It will be
sticky when first put on.</p>

<p><dfn>Leather decay.</dfn> Leather bindings which show
signs of decay may be treated to an application of
vaseline or olive oil, or a solution of paraffin wax
in twice its weight of castor oil, slightly warmed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Rub in well with fingers or cloth. The progress of
decay can in some cases be stopped by this means.</p>

<p><dfn>Labels.</dfn> Take off and replace with fresh ones all
torn and badly soiled back labels. To do this,
apply to them a mixture of two parts water and one
part ammonia. After they are soaked enough to
come off very easily, take them off with a dull knife.
In most cases let the water remain on the label for
several minutes. To scratch off the label without
soaking it first will often injure the book. Labels
that have been varnished are sometimes very difficult
to remove and great care should be exercised with
them.</p>

<p><dfn>Replacing labels.</dfn> Follow method used in putting
them on when book is new, except that it is not
necessary to moisten with ammonia and water the
place on which the label is to go. Use Dennison’s
round gummed label, of a size small enough to rest
entirely on the back of the book. Never let a label
extend over and around the edge of the back. For
quite small books trim the label. Moisten the gum
slightly and press and work it down carefully until
it has set all over. This is very essential. Mark
the book with indelible ink. Cover label with quite
thin white shellac. The shellac should extend a
little onto the book beyond the label all around.
Let the first coat dry thoroughly and then apply a
second.</p>

<p><dfn>Labels on the sides of books.</dfn> If the cover is
durabline or keratol, first put a coat of shellac on the
place where the label is to be placed. Allow this to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
dry. Paste and put on the label, rubbing it down
thoroughly. Allow it to dry and give it a coat of
shellac. If the cover is cloth, use ammonia and
water instead of shellac before putting on the label.</p>

<p><dfn>Loose leaves.</dfn> If the loose leaves are illustrations
in an ordinary novel, take them out and send them
to the picture department. Replace other pictures
with a guard of Japanese mending tissue. This
tissue takes up less space than bond paper and must
always be cut with the grain of the paper or it cannot
well be handled. Rub the tissue down, first laying
over it a piece of paper.</p>

<p><dfn>Single leaves can be inserted in three different ways</dfn>:</p>

<p>1. Fold half-inch strips of bond paper in the center
lengthwise along the grain. With a small brush
apply paste to the outside of this strip. Attach
half of it to the edge of the loose leaf and the other
half to the adjoining leaf, close in by the fold. Cover
the strip with paste evenly, but sparingly and quickly,
stretching it as little as possible. If it does stretch,
and it tends to do so as soon as moistened, it will
when dry wrinkle the page to which it is attached.
Loose leaves should be attached in this way only in
books which are in good condition.</p>

<p>2. Draw a soft piece of twine over a board which
has received a thin coat of paste; then pull this cord
through the back of the book where the loose leaf
is to be inserted. This leaves in the book just enough
paste to hold in the loose leaf. Work the loose
leaf carefully back into its place, close the back and
let it dry. This method is not advised for general use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>3. On the back edge of the loose leaf put a little
paste. Lay the leaf in place and close the book for
a second, then open and push leaf in place with
folder. This method is used with whipstitched
books.</p>

<p>The first two methods are generally used with
books sewed in the ordinary way on tapes or cords.</p>

<p><dfn>Sewing in loose sections and loose leaves.</dfn></p>

<p><dfn>1. Loose back books.</dfn> Thread a darning needle
three inches long with Barbour’s linen thread, No. 40,
or Hayes’s linen thread, No. 20. Open the book in
the middle of the loose section. Near the top and
bottom of the fold will be seen holes made by the
binder. Pass the needle through a hole near the
top, and out between the book and its loose back.
Do not pull the thread clear through. Drop the needle
and thread between the back of the book and the loose
part of the binding to the bottom, then run it from
the outside into the middle of the loose section
through the hole at the bottom thereof, and tie at
the point of beginning. Insert Japanese guard over
thread. This holds the section in fairly well. Always
guard a section before replacing by pasting a half-inch
strip of bond paper, folded in the middle, along
the folds.</p>

<p><dfn>2. Tight-back books.</dfn> Cut a guard of jaconet or
bond paper three-fourths of an inch wide and as
long as the book. Sew the signature to the middle
of this guard and then paste the guard in the book,
attaching half of it to each of the leaves adjoining
the loose section.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p><dfn>Broken bindings.</dfn> Books in publisher’s cloth,
which are breaking out of their bindings, are mended
in some libraries with considerable success as
follows:</p>

<p>The case is taken off with care. If possible, the
lining of the boards is removed in such a way as
to permit of its being put on again. The super
is removed from the margins of the boards and from
the back. Necessary repairs are made to end leaves
and stitches are taken in the book when out of the
case, if need be. The back of the book and the
end leaves are then covered with a thin coat of
flexible glue. The book is then again put together.
This glues the back of the case directly to the back
of the book, making it a tight back. It is reported
that books thus repaired wear very well. Newark
has not had success with this kind of work.</p>

<p><dfn>Fly leaves and end papers.</dfn> To add a new fly leaf.
Cut suitable paper just the length of the leaves of
the book but half an inch wider, fold over the half
inch and paste it; attach this half inch to the last
fly leaf in the book, close to the joint.</p>

<p>If a book has two or more fly leaves, very often
you can save much time and still have your work
look well by turning the first leaf back and pasting
down the page facing.</p>

<p>If leaves stick out of book after they have been
tipped, guarded or sewed in, trim them off even
with the others.</p>

<p>If the end sheet or lining paper of the cover is
soiled or injured, cut a sheet of suitable paper to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
fit the lining paper exactly and paste the new sheet
down all over, fully covering it.</p>

<p>After the new lining paper is put in, keep the
book for a time under moderate pressure or the
cover will curl.</p>

<p><dfn>Loose joints.</dfn> If books are loose along the joint
they can sometimes be repaired by pasting along
the joint inside as a guard a strip of thin muslin
or bond paper, an inch and a quarter wide. Fold
the strip through the center, paste it and apply it
to fly leaf and book cover. A better material than
muslin for this purpose is jaconet, being light in
weight and starched a little. The book should lie
open and flat after mending until it is dry.</p>

<p>This, as has already been noted, is a poor method
of mending a broken joint. By it the strain is passed
from the cover through the new joint to the fly
leaf, and the strength of the new joint is only the
strength of the fly leaf itself, which is generally a
poor piece of paper. A better way, in some cases,
is to take the book entirely out of its cover, pull
the super from the back, sew on new end sheets
and glue a new piece of super or muslin over the
back and extending half an inch onto the sides. Let
this dry thoroughly. Then cover with paste the back
and the end leaves, the latter being the sheets which
are now to become lining papers, and put the book
again into its case. This is recasing, in effect, in
the manner in which the book was first put together.</p>

<p><dfn>Loosened back.</dfn> A book which is in fairly good
condition, with sewing protected, but loose in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
case, can sometimes be strengthened by applying
paste or glue down the inside of the loose back of
the cover. This can be done fairly well with a long
handled brush. This changes the binding from a
loose to a tight back.</p>

<p><dfn>To reattach loose covers.</dfn> The method here
described should be applied only to books which
are little used. Cut a strip of muslin the length of
the book, and about an inch and a half wider than
its back. Apply hot binder’s glue to it and put it
over the back on the outside. When this is dry,
cover the book with brown wrapping paper as
described under the heading “Covering books,” as
a book thus mended is quite unsightly.</p>

<p>When a book is out of the cover, but has its sewing
intact and the super or paper over the sewing
firmly in place, it may be wise to give the back a
coat of hot glue and put book again into its cover,
thus making it a tight back.</p>

<p><dfn>Covering books.</dfn> Cut brown Rugby wrapping paper
into sheets of such a size that they will extend from
2 to 2½ inches all around beyond the book when
laid open on them. This size will be found to be
nearly 13×17 inches for the ordinary 12mo. Lay
the closed book on the paper with back in the center
and toward you, making sure that the proper margin
of paper is left all around. Fold the paper over the
front edge of top cover; reverse book, this time with
front edge toward you, and fold and stretch paper
tight over the front edge of the cover. Take book
by the back in the left hand. With scissors cut the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
paper at top and bottom, with slight inward slant
from its outer edges down to the four ends of the
joints. Take out the book, and turn in these center
flaps with a double fold, putting a little paste on
them after first turn. Replace the book in the cover,
flush with head and tail. Tuck in folds at the corners
of the front and back lap, making not too great
an angle; crease well. The top and bottom laps
should lie over the front and back laps. Put a touch
of paste on laps at corners, but do not put any on
the book itself.</p>

<p><dfn>Re-siding books.</dfn> Books in good condition as to
their bindings, being still solid, but having badly
worn or badly soiled sides, send to bindery to have
the covering of the boards, not the leather of the
back, taken off and replaced with fresh keratol.
This costs about 10 cents per volume. This can
also be done in the repair department, and book
cloth can be used instead of keratol.</p>

<p><dfn>Soiled edges.</dfn> The edges of soiled books can be
somewhat improved by rubbing them with sand paper.</p>

<p><dfn>To cut fore edges of bound book.</dfn> This is never
done to a book of value or to one that can be rebound;
but cheap, shabby books with sound leather backs
which hold together well can be freshened by cutting
the fore edges and, if necessary, residing. Sometimes
one can cut straight down through the front
edges and the two boards, reside and insert new end
pages. This seems a barbarous process; still, it
freshens the appearance of the book very much and
often prolongs its usefulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p><dfn>Maps.</dfn> When small folded maps are badly torn
line them throughout with Japanese tissue, jaconet
or nainsook.</p>

<p><dfn>To freshen black leather.</dfn> Sponge off with ordinary
black ink; dry; rub over with paste; dry; apply
a coat of bookbinders’ varnish; dry; rub with vaseline.</p>

<p><dfn>Broken boards.</dfn> Books which have one or both of
their sides broken, but are otherwise perfect, can
have their boards replaced. Do not do this to
books in publisher’s binding, as such books will
soon have to be rebound in any case.</p>

<p>On a book which is hand sewn, with leather back,
a broken board can be replaced thus: Pull off the
cloth side, lift up the leather carefully where it laps
over the side, also the muslin on the inside and pull
out the broken board. Put hot glue along both
edges of new board to be inserted, and put in place.
Rub down well, and put under pressure, then reside
and insert new end leaf.</p>

<p><dfn>Ink stains.</dfn> These if on the leaves can generally
be removed with ink eradicator or javelle water;
but if they are on the edges and have soaked down
into the book, nothing can be done but to cut the
edges and have the book rebound. If the stains on
the edges have not soaked in very deep, sandpaper
can be used on them with good results.</p>

<p>Ink stains can be removed from Keratol by applying
to them household ammonia of full strength
with a small bristle brush, working it over a little
to loosen the ink. Allow this to stand a minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
or two and then rub with soft cloth and wash well
with water. This cannot be done with imperial
cloth, as ink sinks into its fiber.</p>

<p><dfn>General stains.</dfn> Many brown stains can be removed
with a strong solution of washing soda, or better
with javelle water. Wash with clear water and dry
thoroughly after removing the stain or a dark line
will later appear at the edge of the spot which was
wet; put in a press with clean papers between the
leaves. Alum and water also give fairly good results.
Water and a little ivory soap will remove some finger
marks. All of these methods have the disadvantage
of removing the size or finish in the paper so that it
soils quickly again.</p>

<p><dfn>Grease marks.</dfn> For spots made with grease use
benzine; while still moist apply a hot iron, with a
blotting paper on each side of leaf.</p>

<p><dfn>Paste.</dfn> Paste must not be used if not in a good
condition. The thickness at which it should be used
varies with different kinds of work. Thin paste is
quickly taken up and under its application paper
quickly expands. In most cases this stretching or
expanding of the paper is a disadvantage. If it is
desirable that the paper be so applied as not to
draw or curl that to which it is applied, it should
be covered quickly with thick paste, then applied
at once and not much rubbed after it is in place.</p>

<p>The dishes in which paste is kept should be
thoroughly and often cleaned; brushes the same.
Bits of cloth used in pasting should either be thrown
away or washed after they have been used a short time.</p>

  <span class="subhead">Repairing Books: Materials and Tools</span>
</h2>

<p>In spite of the remarks heretofore made about the
injury often done to books by repairing them, even
when the repairs are cleverly made, it is well for any
library, however small, to have a mending table at
which such work on books as seems necessary can
be done. The materials for this work can in part
be obtained from a bindery. There one can get
super, pieces of book cloth of several colors, and
some of other things mentioned below and in the
list of technical terms. One needs for book repairs
some or all of the following things, according to the
amount of work to be done.</p>

<p><dfn>Brushes.</dfn> Buy a small brush, about as large as
a lead pencil, and another half an inch in diameter.
Their prices vary with their quality, from 6 cents
up. These will be sufficient for most purposes. Get
good ones; and for paste and glue the kind set in
cement, not in glue. Artists’ bristle brushes are good.</p>

<p><dfn>Cloth.</dfn> A yard or two of super. This is stiffened
a little and pastes and handles more easily than
ordinary muslin. If you are going to put backs on
books you will need also pieces of bookbinder’s cloth.
These can be bought at almost any bindery in yard
lengths. Get also pieces of cambric and fine muslin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
called nainsook, or jaconet, for guarding signatures
and similar work. It costs 15 cents a yard.</p>

<p><dfn>Copying press.</dfn> For pressing books. One 10×12
inches will cost about $3.75.</p>

<p><dfn>Cutting board.</dfn> The best cutting board is one of
hard wood. A common bread-board will serve for
small work and costs only a few cents.</p>

<p><dfn>Folder.</dfn> Flat piece of bone. 15 cents.</p>

<p><dfn>Glue pot.</dfn> Get the regular double pot of iron.
A No. 2 will cost about 75 cents.</p>

<p><dfn>Ground glue.</dfn> Best, 18 cents a pound.</p>

<p><dfn>Gummed paper.</dfn> Paper and cloth ready gummed
and other useful repair material can be bought of
Gaylord Bros., Emerson Building, Syracuse, N. Y.,
and also of Holden Patent Book Cover Co., Springfield,
Mass.</p>

<p><dfn>Japanese mending paper.</dfn> Handmade Japanese
Window or Shoji Paper used for mending and guarding
can be obtained from Japan Paper Co., 34 Union
Sq., N. Y. Price $5.00 per ream of 500 sheets 16×22.
This is the best of all mending papers for repairing
torn leaves.</p>

<p><dfn>Knife.</dfn> A good knife is what is called a shoemaker’s
knife, a long blade, square at the end. 15
cents. Keep the corner square by occasionally
knocking a piece off the end. For a sharpener wrap
a piece of fine emery paper about a square stick and
tack it down.</p>

<p><dfn>Mending tissue.</dfn> See Japanese mending paper.</p>

<p><dfn>Needles.</dfn> Several sizes, especially the regular sewing
needles of the binder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p><dfn>Paper.</dfn> Different kinds of book paper, to be
obtained from any printer, will be needed for replacing
end sheets, also thin bond paper for guarding
leaves. Rope manila of the best quality will also
be found useful. Get also some of the rolls of adhesive
paper sold by The Dennison Manufacturing Company,
11 Dey St., New York (¾ inches wide, per
dozen spools 40 cents), for mending torn pages. It
is very convenient.</p>

<p><dfn>Paste.</dfn> Buy this at a bindery, if you use much.
For occasional use it can be thus made: stir flour
in cold water until smooth, add hot water, let it
boil for a few minutes, and add a little salt and
alum as preservatives. Good paste can be bought
in jars. Higgins’s is the best. The cost is 25 cents
per 8-ounce jar. Almost any stationer carries it,
or it can be ordered of Charles M. Higgins, 168
Eighth St., Brooklyn. A convenient thing for paste
in small quantities is the tube. The several makes
are all about equally good.</p>

<p>Paste made of starch is best for work on fine
books, as it is more transparent and shows less
than other paste.</p>

<p><dfn>Ruler.</dfn> One with a brass edge is handy, but not
essential.</p>

<p><dfn>Scissors.</dfn> Slender, 6-inch blades, good quality,
75 cents.</p>

<p><dfn>Sewing bench.</dfn> This can be made as follows:
Take a board 24 in. long and 10 in. wide. On the
side of it and 14 in. apart nail two uprights, ¾ in.
square and a foot long. Across the top of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
nail a stick ¾ in. square. Tacks can be driven into
the board and into the cross stick above where
needed, and cords or tapes stretched between them.
This gives you all the essentials of a sewing bench.</p>

<p><dfn>Thread.</dfn> Some of Hayes’s best Irish linen thread,
smaller size, say No. 18. Or Barbour’s linen, No. 30.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
  <span class="subhead">Covering Books</span>
</h2>

<p>Few libraries now cover their books. The reasons
for covering them usually given are, that the paper
covers gather dust less easily than do the publisher’s
cloth bindings; and that the paper covers can be
renewed when soiled and books can thus be kept at
small expense fairly clean as to their exteriors.</p>

<p>The objections to the paper cover may thus be
stated: It takes away the individuality of the book
and thus detracts from its interest; the cover has a
tendency, unless very carefully put on, to strain the
back of the book; borrowers are more careless in
handling a covered than an uncovered book.</p>

<p>The only use the Newark Library has found for
book covers is on old volumes which are very rarely
used and yet are too broken or too much worn and
disfigured to look well on the shelf. Frequently
old leather bindings crack along the joint so that the
sides separate from the back. When this occurs
a piece of muslin covered with hot glue applied
to the back of the book, extending onto the sides,
will hold it together fairly well, and then a paper
cover hides the defacement.</p>

<p>The process of putting on a paper cover is described
in the chapter on Repairing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>The Newark Library has experimented with several
materials and at this date has found that Rugby
wrapping paper has given better satisfaction than
any other. It is a tough brown paper, which can
be obtained from Lindenmeyr &amp; Sons, New York.
Cost, $3.30 per ream; size, 24×36, 60 lbs.</p>

<p>The arguments for covering books used in schools
are somewhat different from those that may be applied
in regard to the same practice for books in libraries.
The Holden Patent Book Cover Company, of Springfield,
Mass., makes an adjustable cover of very stout,
water-proof paper. This cover and others akin to
it are used to a great extent in the public schools.</p>

<p>The same Holden Company publishes a little
pamphlet called, “How to Care for Books and Keep
Them in Perfect Repair.” This they present to
teachers who make use of their appliances for repairing
books. These appliances include thin transparent
paper glued on both sides; the same glued on one
side; polished cloth in several colors glued on one
side; paper in long strips, so folded and glued that
they can be conveniently used to strengthen and
repair bindings; self-binders, which are strips of
glued cloth with little tongues cut out and projecting
from them, that may be used to hold cover and book
together.</p>

<p>It appears that in schools which purchase materials
like those made by the Holden Company, and
instruct their teachers to use them on books as soon
as any of them show the need of repairs, the annual
cost of text-books is reduced. Probably the cost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
would be still more reduced were the books mended
very little by a skilled person, and were they properly
rebound as soon as they need to be.</p>

<p>Gaylord Brothers, of Syracuse, N. Y., make and
sell repair material similar to that of the Holden
Company.</p>

<p>Further light is thrown on this subject by certain
answers to questions recently received from forty
superintendents in the United States. These answers
show that in two only of forty cities where text-books
are furnished is any systematic attention given
to the care of text-books. In two cities there is an
official curator of books who looks after the covering,
repairing, and rebinding of them.</p>

<p>The custom in public schools seems to be to purchase
text-books, to keep them in use with a minimum
of repairs until they are too tattered and soiled to
be thought respectable even by the most careless
teacher, and then throw them away. This practice
is probably wasteful and extravagant; at least it
seems to be so in the light of the experience in libraries
in the same matter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
  <span class="subhead">Leather: General Notes</span>
</h2>

<p>The names given to different kinds of leather
come sometimes from the character of its surface,
that is, from the “grain,” or roughness or corrugation
it has; sometimes from the animal it once
covered; sometimes from the method of tanning;
sometimes from the fact that it is part of a skin which
has been split; sometimes from the place or country
where it is made or where the animal it once covered
lived, and sometimes from a combination of two or
more of these.</p>

<p>The subject of the leathers used in bookbinding
is a very difficult one. Tanners, dealers and binders,
dictionaries, encyclopædias and books on tanning
disagree with one another as to the proper terms to
use in speaking of different kinds of leather. Imitations
are many, and very successful. In the list
below I have tried to follow the usage of binders;
but I am sure no expert would accept it throughout
as correct.</p>

<p>With this variety in definition goes a corresponding
variety in character in leather of the same name.
Different skins tanned in the same way, apparently,
and called by the same name by dealers and binders,
will wear, some well, some not so well. The only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
quite definite assertion which can be made is, that
of modern leathers, few save the best morocco and
pigskin will keep their strength for any length of
time in an American library, and morocco and pigskin
usually for not much over 20 years.</p>

<p>As the remarks which follow indicate, English
leather makers have recently procured leathers guaranteed
to be dressed on the lines recommended by
the Society of Arts Report. See also the revised
report, and the little volume, with samples, called
Leather for Libraries by Hulme, Parker and others.</p>

<p>Leathers made from the skins of animals of the same
kind, the goat for example, though made by the same
process, vary somewhat with the animals’ sex, age
when killed, the food on which they lived, the
climate in which they matured, and their manner
of life, and, if females, with the fact that they have
or have not had young. Also, the leather made from
the skin of one part of the body differs materially
from that made from the skin of another part.</p>

<p>Moreover, some dyes seem to hasten decay, some
to retard it. Red seems least hurtful, black the
most so; though this difference is probably due more
to chemicals used in the preparation of the skin for
the dye than to the dye itself. Brown generally
stands well; most other colors, except red as stated,
do not.</p>

<p>With all these, and other, factors to be taken into
consideration it is evident that full knowledge of
leather is not given to anyone. In a general way
it may be said that good leather cannot be told by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
name, or looks, or feel; but only by trial. Dealers,
even, cannot tell the good from the best.</p>

<p>The sum of all advice is, having found, by your
own or others’ tests, that a certain leather is good,
use it as long as you can get it. The British museum
sets a good example in this. It has in recent years
bound many thousands of volumes in morocco made
by Meredith-Jones &amp; Sons, Wrexham, Wales, which
experience thus far shows to be very good. We
have tried it and in the brief trial we have given
it, found it excellent.</p>

<p>Dr. J. Gordon Parker, Herold’s Institute, Drummond
Road, Bermondsey, England, has made an
arrangement with the council of the Library Association
of England by which he has become their
official examiner of leather and he will test samples
for acids, nature of tannage, etc., at reasonable rates.</p>

<p>John Muir &amp; Son, tanners and curriers, Beith,
Scotland, offices: 3 Arundel St., Strand, London,
W. C., England, prepare pigskin for bookbinding;
so do Edw. &amp; Jas. Richardson, Elswick Leather
Works, Newcastle-on-Tyne, England.</p>

<p>J. Meredith-Jones &amp; Sons, Ltd., Cambrian Leather
Works, Wrexham, Wales, make bookbinders’ leathers
guaranteed to be dressed on the lines recommended
by the Society of Arts Report, and free from mineral
acids. Specialty: Welsh sheep.</p>

<p>Much has been written on the wearing and lasting
qualities of leather. The best discussion of the
subject is the Report of the committee on leather
for bookbinding, made to the Society of Arts, England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and published in its Journal, July 5, 1901. I
allude to this report frequently, and for convenience
speak of it as “Report ’01.” The committee who
made this report found that the leather made today
does not last as long as that made 75 years ago.
They found that the heat and fumes of gas help
to hasten the decay of the leather on books. These
factors are more effective in American superheated
libraries than in English ones. If books bound in
leather are much handled they last longer than if
they stand undisturbed on the shelves, because the
oil from the hand helps to keep leather soft, pliable,
and alive. The committee concluded that no leather,
with the sole exception of Niger goat, made by the
natives on the river Niger in Africa, and imported
just as it leaves their hands, can be fully recommended
as free from elements which lead to its early
decay. Since this report was published imitations
of this leather have been put on the market, and it
can no longer be relied upon. We have found it
beautiful in color and texture, easy to work and
wearing admirably on large and much-used books.
But it does not keep clean as well as a good morocco
of coarse grain. It is very expensive, and first-class
morocco is probably better where strong, enduring
leather is advisable which is only on books which
are to be much used.</p>

<p>The most important points made in the report of
the Society of Arts committee on leather for bookbinding,
referred to above, are the following:</p>

<p>Books bound during the last 80 or 100 years show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
far greater evidence of deterioration than those of
an earlier date. Many recent bindings show evidence
of decay after so short a period as ten or even five,
years. Modern leather is certainly far less durable
than old leather.</p>

<p>The most prevalent decay is a red decay, and
this may be differentiated into old and new, the
old red decay being noticeable up to about 1830,
and the new decay since that date.</p>

<p>Another form of deterioration, more noticeable in
the newer books, renders the grain of the leather
liable to peel off when exposed to the slightest friction.
This is the most common form of decay noted
in the most recent leathers.</p>

<p>Decay is caused by both mechanical and chemical
influences. Of the latter some are due to mistakes
of the leather manufacturer and the bookbinder,
others to the want of ventilation, and improper
heating and lighting of libraries. In some cases
inferior leathers are finished (by methods in themselves
injurious) to imitate a better class of leathers,
and of course where these are used durability cannot
be expected. But in the main the injury for which
the manufacturer and bookbinder are responsible
must be attributed rather to ignorance of the effect
of the means employed to give the leather the outward
qualities required for binding, than to the
intentional production of an inferior article.</p>

<p>Embossing leather under heavy pressure to imitate
a grain has a very injurious effect.</p>

<p>The shaving of thick skins greatly reduces the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
strength of the leather by cutting away the tough
fibers of the inner part of the skin.</p>

<p>The use of mineral acids in brightening the color
of leather, and in the process of dyeing, has a serious
effect in lessening its resistance to decay.</p>

<p>Quite modern leather dyed black seems, in nearly
all cases, to have perished, although old black morocco
(sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries)
in good condition is not uncommon.</p>

<p>In a very large proportion of cases the decay of
modern sumac-tanned leather has been due to the
sulphuric acid used in the dye bath, and retained in
the skin.</p>

<p>Tobacco smoke has a darkening and deleterious
effect on leather bindings.</p>

<p>Light, and especially direct sunlight and hot air,
possess deleterious influences which had scarcely
been suspected.</p>

<p>Gas fumes are the most injurious of all the influences
to which books are subjected, no doubt because
of sulphuric and sulphurous acid they contain. They
are especially injurious to books on the upper shelves
of a high room.</p>

<p>The importance of moderate temperature and
thorough ventilation of libraries cannot be too much
insisted on. With proper conditions of ventilation,
temperature, and dryness, books may be preserved
without deterioration, for very long periods, on open
shelves.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as a general rule, tightly fitting
glass cases conduce to their preservation.</p>

<p>Leather bindings that have been coated with glair
or varnish seem to keep better than those without.</p>

<p>The bookbinder shares, in no small measure, with
the leather manufacturer and librarian, the blame
for the premature decay of leather bindings.</p>

<p>Books are sewn on too few and too thin cords,
and are not firmly laced into the boards. This
renders the attachment of the boards to the book
almost entirely dependent on the strength of the
leather.</p>

<p>The use of hollow backs usually throws too much
strain on the joints in opening and shutting the book.</p>

<p>If the headbands are not strong the leather of the
back is apt to become torn.</p>

<p>The leather is often made very wet and stretched
a great deal in covering, with the result that, on
drying, it is further strained, almost to breaking
point, by contraction, leaving a very small margin
of strength to meet the accidents of use.</p>

<p>The use of oxalic acid for washing backs of books,
or of leather for bookbinding, is fatal to durability.
Vinegar, even in its pure state, is injurious.</p>

<p>Paste should be used in a fresh condition, otherwise
it is liable to undergo an acid fermentation, and
to favor the growth of injurious moulds and bacteria.</p>

<p>In all contracts and specifications for bookbinding,
the use of East India-tanned goat and sheep, whether
retanned or not, should be absolutely forbidden.</p>

<p>It appears to be the general opinion that leather,
and especially Russia leather, lasts better on books
that are in constant use. This is attributed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
slight amount of grease absorbed by the leather
from the hand, and it is suggested that possibly a
suitable dressing may be discovered which would
have a similar effect to that produced by this grease.</p>

<p>While the leather now used for binding books is
less durable than that employed 50 years and more
ago, there ought to be no difficulty in providing
leather at the present time as good as any previously
made.</p>

<p>It is possible to test any leather in such a way as
to guarantee its suitability for bookbinding.</p>

<p>A reissue of the report summarized above was
published, in cloth, in 1905. It is entered in the list
of books at the end of this volume. In this reissue
the arrangement of the original report is somewhat
modified; a paper on leather dyes and dyeing has
been added; the report of the scientific sub-committee
has been practically rewritten; many illustrations
have been added, some of them colored; 12 samples
of leather prepared in accordance with the committee’s
conclusions are inserted; and the volume is
handsomely printed, and bound in cloth. The
reissue, however, does not make necessary any change
in the above summary.</p>

  <span class="subhead">Paper and Paper Making</span>
</h2>

<p>Much of the paper used in books today is made
of wood. Wood is converted into paper-making
material in three ways. In one, it is cut into convenient
lengths, stripped of its bark and finely ground
on grindstones, and bleached. The product is called
ground wood pulp. The paper made from this pulp
is hastily and cheaply put together, has little strength,
and soon turns yellow and grows brittle. There is
often added to ground wood before making it into
paper, more or less sulphite or soda pulp, usually
the latter, the product of another process of turning
wood into paper-making material.</p>

<p>In the sulphite and soda processes the wood is
freed of bark, cut into small pieces, and reduced to
a pulp by being heated with water and chemicals
under pressure in an air-tight steel tank or boiler.
Sulphite and soda pulp, which get their names from
chemicals used in reducing the wood to pulp, have
longer and better fiber than ground wood pulp. In
both processes certain means are used to whiten the
fiber and free it from sap, gum, and other things
which would prevent it from acting properly in the
paper-making machine, or would tend to make it
grow yellow or spotted. Spruce or basswood are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the woods chiefly used, and they seem to submit
themselves to treatment better and to give a longer
fiber than other kinds. The pulp made from rags is
often mixed with sulphite and soda pulp. The rag-pulp
fiber improves the quality of the resulting paper
for reasons not easily set forth. Paper made entirely
of wood may be of good quality, especially sulphite
papers. The popular outcry against wood paper is
based on the fact that much of it is made very cheaply
and poorly.</p>

<p>The rags used in paper making are nearly all
cotton. They are not all of them rags in the ordinary
sense of the term. Many of them are cuttings from
clothing factories and have never been used. New
rags do not act the same way under the treatment
which changes them to paper pulp as do the old
ones. The paper made entirely from new cloth
differs somewhat from that made from old rags. The
best book papers, however, contain only stock prepared
from old rags.</p>

<p>The process of changing rags into paper is very
similar to that of changing wood into paper. The
rags are cleaned, freed from foreign substances, cut
into small pieces, thoroughly washed, bleached, and
then beaten to a pulp, under water, by machines which
convert them into a soft, homogeneous, creamy mass,
called technically stuff, and yet preserve the greatest
possible length of fiber. This process of beating rags
into good paper-making material requires care and
considerable time. If the process is hastened unduly
the resulting material is not so good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Paper is made from other materials besides wood
and cotton; but nearly all of that used in books in
this country is made of one or other of these two
materials, or of a combination of the two.</p>

<p>The stuff produced as described, almost milk-like
in its consistency, is pumped from a tank, in which
it is kept constantly stirred to prevent the fiber from
settling, onto the paper-making machine. This
machine is an evolution from a simple hand appliance
which was used by paper makers for several
centuries. It was a shallow tray with a bottom
made of a network of wires. This was held in the
hands, dipped into a vat containing the paper-making
material, and as much of the latter taken up on the
wires as in the judgment of the maker was sufficient
for a sheet of paper. It was then shaken gently,
and deftly handled, until the water, running through
the wires, left on the latter, and spread evenly over
them, a layer of fibers. These dried and matted
together in a few seconds sufficiently to enable the
maker to turn them out on a blanket; on this another
blanket was spread, and on this was laid another
layer of fibers. The skilful maker of paper by hand
(in a few places in this country the craft is still
practiced) can secure considerable evenness in the
layers of fiber or pulp on the wire of his frame; but
the layer is never of quite the same thickness throughout.
Handmade paper can sometimes be distinguished
by these variations in its thickness. Machine-made
paper is of nearly uniform thickness. In the
process of taking up from the vat by hand a thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
layer of stuff, the maker wove together the fibers
in every direction by skilful and delicate movements
of the frame. A paper-making machine cannot so
thoroughly interweave the fibers. Paper made by
hand, therefore, has a quality which cannot be
secured on a machine. This peculiar texture of
handmade paper of the first class delights the connoisseur,
and furnishes a printing surface superior,
in some respects, to any machine-made paper.</p>

<p>The paper-making machine consists primarily of
an endless roll of wire screen, similar to that forming
the bottom of the shallow tray used in making paper
by hand. This wire screen, stretched around rollers,
travels almost horizontally away from a broad shelf
from which it receives a stream of stuff pumped onto
the latter from the tank before mentioned. As the
pulp pours out onto this wire it settles over the
screen, and is woven together by the latter’s oscillating
and forward movement, and by the time it
reaches the end of the screen is sufficiently matted
and dry to hold its shape, the water being removed
by suction. It is then picked up by a roller, and
goes through a succession of rolls, varying in size,
number, character, heat and pressure, according to
the quality of the paper being made and the surface
desired thereon. In some cases, toward the close
of the process, it is passed through a tank containing
a thin mixture of glue and water, called size, and then
is again dried. Coming out as paper at the end it is
cut into lengths and piled, or gathered on a roll.</p>

<p>The wire diaphragm onto which the paper pulp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
first pours, and during the passage over which it is
worked into a mat, the water meanwhile being
extracted from it, is of varying styles. If perfectly
plain the resulting paper is almost without marks,
and is said to be wove. If made of wires of different
sizes properly arranged the paper, as it lies on it,
receives deeper impressions from the larger wires
than from the smaller and the former appear as
light lines running through it when finished. Paper
thus marked is called laid, to distinguish it from the
wove. As the paper comes from the wires it passes
under the dandy roll. This roll sometimes has
figures or letters raised on its surface. These impress
themselves on the soft paper and produce a greater
transparency where they touch, sometimes reducing
the thickness, and give the finished paper what is
called a watermark. It is so called not because it is
made of water or by water, but because it looks as
though it were drawn on the paper with a point
dipped in water.</p>

<p>Endless varieties of paper can be made from the
same materials. It may contain more or less rag;
may be beaten to a greater or less extent and with
more or less care; may be spread thicker or thinner;
may be rolled on hot rolls, or polished, more or less;
may receive more or less sizing; may be dyed in a
vat before it starts for the machine, or dipped in dye
after it is made, or color may be applied to one surface
by machine. The fiber may be carelessly produced,
and the chemicals used in bleaching and
cleaning it may be only partially neutralized, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the result that the paper will soon act as if being
eaten with acid, and will rapidly turn yellow under
a bright light.</p>

<p>The ordinary observer can distinguish between
very poor and fairly good paper in books. He cannot
distinguish between paper of fairly good quality
and the best.</p>

<p>The paper used in newspapers is nearly all made
entirely of ground wood. Most of it is made as
cheaply as possible, and soon grows brittle and dark
in color. This is of little consequence in most cases.
For the ordinary newspaper the paper has served its
purpose if it looks well for twenty-four hours after it
is printed and exposed to the light.</p>

<p>Books are generally printed on paper which has
not been very highly polished. Ink is taken from
the type more readily by paper of this kind, especially
if the latter be rather soft in texture, so that
the press drives into it the face of the type bearing
the ink. Modern processes of reproducing pictures
give plates for printing, many of which are made up
of very fine lines placed very closely together and
having very shallow depressions between them. To
print from these with good results the paper used
must have a very smooth, highly polished surface.
The press drives soft paper down into the narrow
places between the fine lines and blurs the impression
of the cut. Newspapers which use process-cuts of
the kind mentioned are obliged to use paper with a
smooth surface to get good results. This smooth
surface is generally produced, as already noted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
by passing the paper between hot metal rollers, a
process called calendering. In a more expensive
process, called plating, the paper, cut into sheets,
is laid between sheets of zinc until a pile of several
inches in thickness is formed, and this pile is passed
several times under rollers exerting a heavy pressure.
This smooths, polishes and hardens the paper.
Much of the paper used for illustrations in books
has a surface made by applying a coating of clay
or other material to it and then polishing it. Quite
good results can be obtained with fine line cuts on
calendered or plated paper without the addition of
a coating of clay. The illustrations on coated paper
which are found in books are very commonly printed
separately from the book itself, which is on ordinary
uncoated paper, and inserted separately. Generally
these inserts are not carefully fastened in and cause
much annoyance by falling out after the book has
been subjected to a little use.</p>

<p>Recently paper makers have succeeded in producing
a paper which has a smooth surface without the
high polish usually found on that which is coated,
or highly calendered. The polished surface of these
papers, especially of the coated, is very objectionable
to readers, light being reflected from it in an unpleasant
way.</p>

<p>It will be seen from what has been said that it is
difficult so to describe what we may call good book
paper that it can be readily distinguished. Constant
study and careful comparisons of the papers
one meets in books will enable one to judge of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
with some success. One who has much to do with
books should take note of the paper of which they
are made, and learn to distinguish between poor
and good, and the good and the best, as far as possible.
This is especially desirable for one whose
work with books includes their rebinding and repairing.
Coated paper breaks easily, the stiffening
added to it by the coat of clay giving it a tendency
to fall apart as soon as it has been folded in the same
place a few times. Soft and fragile paper, such as
is found in many books, will stand very little wear
at the joint in the back. Paper not carefully bleached
and freed from the chemicals used in bleaching,
rapidly discolors at the edges where exposed to light.
Such facts as these, and many others, will be found
useful when one comes to have books rebound, or
attempts to repair them.</p>

<p>That side of the paper which touched the wires
on which it is made is different from the other. This
difference is usually visible to the trained eye. It
is often taken into consideration in fine printing.</p>

<p>As the pulp flows out upon the wires it tends to
mat together more thoroughly along the line of flow
than across it. This gives paper a grain, along which
it tears and folds more readily than across it. This
fact also is often taken advantage of in good printing.</p>

<p>All paper expands or stretches when wet. This
is to be kept in mind in mending books. An added
strip, pasted on, usually draws and wrinkles, when it
dries, the paper to which it is applied. Hence the
rule, in mending, to use thick paste and apply the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
pasted sheet or strip to its place as quickly after
pasting as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Chivers has recently made, 1909, with the
help of chemists and other experts, a very careful
examination of the composition, structure, tensile
and folding strength and other qualities of the paper
now used in several thousand popular books. The
results of this examination, when applied to the
subjects of book-selection and book-buying, will be
of great value to libraries. The quality of the paper
used in the books on which libraries spend a large
per cent. of their book fund—novels—is the question
that should be first considered in selecting editions.
Libraries may hope soon to be able to select editions
much more wisely than heretofore. The investigations
by Mr. Chivers, and those carried on by U. S.
Government experts in Washington, will not only
enable libraries to discover the best editions for
purchase, but will also enable them to secure bindings
so carefully adapted to the quality of the paper
in each book as to give that book the longest possible
life of usefulness.</p>

  <span class="subhead">Binding Records</span>
</h2>

<p>By binding records are meant the reports of books
sent to the bindery, their return, styles, cost, etc.
There are many ways of keeping these. For the
small library great simplicity is desirable and possible.
The large library usually works out a method
adapted to its own conditions.</p>

<p>In sending books to a binder it is usually not
necessary to keep any record other than the book
card, on which may be written or stamped the word
Binder and the date sent. To this may be added a
few words or a number indicating material and style.
The binder himself is usually content with general
instructions for each separate lot, such as, “These
25 vols. bind in half brown cowskin with keratol sides;
special sewing.” Some libraries attach a note to the
title-page of each book saying how it is to be bound
and giving the lettering for the back. This is not often
necessary. It is usual to note the latter point on the
title page by underscoring the first letter of each word
which is to appear on the back. In doing this, reduce
the lettering as far as possible by omitting unnecessary
words. In most libraries, for example, the new title
for “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” can be
reduced to advantage to “Huck Finn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Special books must be specially marked of course,
and books in sets and series should be lettered in
the same style throughout. This can be assured by
sending a sample volume or a rubbing of the back.
The rubbing is got by laying a piece of paper on the
back of the volume the style of which is to be copied
and rubbing it hard with a large, soft pencil or rub-off
wax.</p>

<p>As books are returned they should be checked by
whatever record was kept of them. Then their
number, sizes and styles should be entered in a book
kept for the purpose. From these items the bill will
be checked when sent in.</p>

  <span class="subhead">Binding Records and Notes, Newark</span>
</h2>

<p class="hang">Rules followed in Newark Library in sending books
to bindery.</p>

<p>Remove book slip, having first compared its number
with the number on the book pocket. This
book slip is stamped with the word Bindery and with
the date, and then is filed with other similar slips,
all being kept in groups in accordance with the kinds
of binding the books are to receive. The slips for
the books sent each month are also put together.</p>

<p>On the title page of the book underline with light
pencil marks such words as are to be gilded on the
back. Make the title for the back as short as it
can be made without loss of identity. If the name
on the title page is a pseudonym, write the author’s
correct name beside it in small letters.</p>

<p>Most books are sent in groups with a general note
of instruction as to the binding of the whole group.
For example, a hundred books may be sent in one
lot with a note saying, “Bind in pigskin in the usual
style.”</p>

<p>When special bindings are required, which call for
special instructions, tip slightly in the front of the
book, usually on the title page, a slip of yellow paper
3×5 inches. Bright yellow is chosen because it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
easily distinguished from the white paper of the
book, even at night, and yet writing on it is quite
legible. On this slip write the call number of the
book, the special style of binding wanted and other
remarks when needed, such as the following:</p>

<p>Rush. If the book is to be returned in haste.</p>

<p>See sample. When book is one of two or more
volumes and a special style of binding is to be carried
out through the whole set.</p>

<p>Do not trim at all. When the book is of some
special character and it is desired to preserve all the
paper.</p>

<p>When books come back from the bindery stamp
the date of their return on the lower left corner of
the back cover immediately on their receipt. Add
to this date the name of the binder if the library
employs more than one firm.</p>

<p>This date makes it possible to tell how bindings
wear, how many years they last, etc.</p>

<p>Note the style of binding of each book and look
for its book slip among the other slips for books of
this style.</p>

<p>For some reasons it would be wise to keep the
slips from all books sent to the bindery in one alphabetical
series. In the Newark Library this proves
not to be as convenient as the method described, of
keeping it first by days or months and next by styles
of binding.</p>

<p>Examine the lettering and the numbers on the
back to see if they are correct, comparing with
the title page. Examine also the binding throughout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>If all is satisfactory, put pockets and book plates
in all the books which require them.</p>

<p>Mark the pockets. Open each book carefully
and thoroughly that the back may be loosened and
made more flexible.</p>

<p>All magazines send with yellow slips containing
directions as to style of binding, etc.</p>

  <span class="subhead">Bindery Equipment</span>
</h2>

<p>The small library will find it does not pay to have
a bindery of its own. This is a safe general rule to
which there are exceptions, of course. Special conditions,
such as remoteness from good binderies,
may make it worth while for a library which spends
only about $1,000 a year in binding to put in a small
plant and do its own work. Even then, however,
it is usually better to find a binder who will take
the contract from the library at a fixed price per
volume, using the library’s room and material.
Such a binder can sometimes get additional work
from other libraries or from private individuals.
It should be noted that the amount paid for binding
is not quite all that a binder who works in the library
may expect to divert to his own shop; for a clever
and obliging workman will make himself useful in
repairing and in doing many small jobs of cutting,
mounting, etc., which will add a good deal to his
income. Still, as I have said, the small library will
usually find that it is not economical to have its
own bindery. Were there in this country plenty
of commercial binderies, where first-rate work is
done at fair prices—I do not mean low prices—it
would not pay even the larger libraries to open their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
own binderies. The large shop is the only place in
which some of the most important economies are
possible, and only the large shop can afford to hire
the most competent foremen and workers. Even
the large libraries find it wise to rent their binderies
to competent men who will do binding at contract
prices. Under this arrangement some libraries find
it pays to give up room to a bindery; though, as I
have already remarked, they would not find it economical
to do so were there efficient library binding
establishments in the immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>As the large libraries have a good deal of work
which the average commercial binder does not care
to take, like map mounting, rare-book mending, and
ordinary book repairs, the ideal condition for them
would be a small bindery with two or three hands,
in the building; a contract for all ordinary binding
and rebinding with an outsider, and the purchase
of many new books especially bound direct from the
sheets.</p>

<p>The following list includes the machinery, tools
and materials needed in opening a bindery. The
full list would equip fairly well a shop employing one
foreman, who is also a finisher; one forwarder; one
boy (helper or apprentice), and three girls for sewing.
This shop would turn out, say, 10,000 books a year,
its output depending very largely on the character
of the work.</p>

<p>If the shop is to bind, say, only 2,000 books per
year the items marked S on the list will prove sufficient.
These estimates are very general.<br /><br /></p>

<p>The quotations are from the report of committee
on leather of the Society of Arts, England, 1901.</p>

<p><dfn>Aldine or Italian Style.</dfn> Ornaments of solid face
without any shading whatever, such as used by Aldus
and other early Italian printers. The ornaments are
of Arabic character. A style appropriate for early
printed literature.</p>

<p><dfn>All-along.</dfn> When a volume is sewed, and the
thread passes from kettlestitch to kettlestitch, or
from end to end in each sheet, it is said to be sewed
all-along.</p>

<p><dfn>American Russia.</dfn> See Cowhide.</p>

<p><dfn>Antique.</dfn> See Blind-tooled.</p>

<p><dfn>Arabesque Style.</dfn> A fanciful mixture of animals,
birds, insects, and of plants, fruits and foliage, involved
and twisted.</p>

<p><dfn>Arming press.</dfn> See Blocking press.</p>

<p><dfn>Art canvas.</dfn> A book cloth, made in several colors
by the Holliston Mills, 67 Fifth Ave., New York;
Jos. Bancroft &amp; Sons, Wilmington, Del. (A. D.
Smith, 35 Thomas St., New York, agent); the Interlaken
Mills, 111 Duane St., New York, and others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>It is known both as art canvas and buckram. The
Newark library, in experimenting to find a substitute
for leather, tried in succession the green, red, brown
and blue. The green proved the poorest, the blue
made by Holliston Mills the best in wearing quality.
One reason for the poor results with all the colors
tried, with the exception of the blue, is that the cloth
of these colors is made with a colored thread running
one way and a gray or white thread the other; the
colored thread soon wears off on the edges and corners
and the gray thread gives the book a very dingy
appearance. Dark blue has given us the best results.
Art canvas costs 22 cents a square yard by the roll
of 40 yards.</p>

<p><dfn>Art vellum.</dfn> A book cloth made in several colors
and styles of finish by the firms which make art canvas.
It is not suitable for full binding on books
subject to much wear. It costs about 16 cents per
square yard. Most publishers’ bindings are in cloth
of the art vellum grade.</p>

<p>Our own experience with art canvas and art vellum
for full bindings on books much used seems to have
been that of many other libraries. Popular books
in these materials from about a dozen public libraries
all seem to have worn poorly. The joints soon
become soft and loose; the corners fray out and look
ragged; the gold of the titles does not stand out well
when first put on and rapidly grows dim.</p>

<p><dfn>Azure’ tools.</dfn> Used in binding, where the heavy
and wide marks, instead of being a solid mass, are
made with horizontal lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p><dfn>Azured style.</dfn> Ornamentations outlined in gold
and crossed with horizontal lines in the manner of
indicating azure in heraldry.</p>

<p><dfn>Back, tight and loose.</dfn> Binding is said to be tight
back when the leather, cloth or other material of
the back is pasted or glued to the back of the book.
This style of binding is commonly used in fine work.
Most books, often quite large ones, were formerly
bound in this way.</p>

<p>Binding is said to be loose back when the leather,
cloth or other material of the back is fastened to
the book only along the joints. To the question,
which is the better binding for library books, no
definite answer can be given.</p>

<p><dfn>Backing.</dfn> Bending over the folds at the back of
a book to form a ridge or projection called a joint.</p>

</div>

<p><dfn>Backing boards.</dfn> Used for backing or forming the
joint. They are made of very hard wood or faced
with iron, and are thicker on the edge intended to
form the groove than upon the edge that goes toward
the fore-edge of the book, so that when placed one
each side of the book and all are placed in the laying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>

the back.</p>

    <p class="center bold">Backing Hammer</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p><dfn>Backing hammer.</dfn> The
hammer used for backing
and rounding. It has a
broad, flat face similar to a
shoemaker’s hammer.</p>

<p><dfn>Backing machine.</dfn> A machine
for backing books.
If not carefully handled it
is apt to injure books by crushing and breaking the
paper at the folds. Used on publishers’ binding.</p>

<p><dfn>Backing press.</dfn> A press having two, vertically
mounted, steel plates brought together by a screw.
A book is held in this press with the back slightly
projecting above the plates, and then backed with a
hammer.</p>

<p><dfn>Band-driver.</dfn> A tool used in forwarding to correct
irregularities in the bands of flexible backs.</p>

<p><dfn>Band nippers.</dfn> Pinchers with flat jaws used for
straightening bands by nipping up the leather after
it is in place. They should be nickeled to prevent
the iron staining the leather.</p>

<p><dfn>Bands.</dfn> The strings, cord or twine on which a
book is sewed. They are usually made of hemp, are
loosely twisted, are 2, 3, 4-ply according to the size
of the book, and cost about 35 cents per pound.
This twine is loosely twisted that it may be flexible
and less likely to break when glued and dried, and
that it may be easily frayed out at the ends for
pasting down on the inside of the covers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>When the book is sewed flexible the bands appear
upon the back. When the back is so sewn as to let
in the twine, the appearance of raised bands is produced,
if at all, by gluing narrow strips of leather
across the back before the volume is covered. A
hard, closely twisted cord is also sometimes used in
fine binding.</p>

are used for pressing cloth-work. See also In
boards.</p>

<p><dfn>Brass-bound boards.</dfn> See Boards.</p>

<p><dfn>Broken up.</dfn> When plates are folded over a short

in the book, that they may be turned easily, they are
said to be broken up. The same process is sometimes
applied to an entire book.</p>

<p><dfn>Buckram.</dfn> Properly a coarse linen cloth, stiffened

It has a smooth and uniform surface. It was formerly
much used in binding, and is very beautiful;
but that made in recent years lasts only a short time,
soon growing hard and brittle and even falling into
dust. Even when new the surface is easily broken
and torn.</p>

<p>“During the latter part of the eighteenth century
it became customary to pare down calf until it was
as thin as paper. Since about 1830 little sound calf
seems to have been made, as, whether thick or thin,
it appears generally to have perished, turning red
and crumbling into dust.”</p>

<p>“Sprinkled or marbled calf is in a specially bad
state.”</p>

<p>See also Divinity, Kip, Marbled, Sprinkled and
Tree calf.</p>

<p><dfn>Calf-lined.</dfn> When the inside of a limp cover is
lined with calfskin, this taking the place of that
half of the end paper which is usually on the inside
of the cover. This calf lining is thin and soft and is
usually glued to the leather cover only at the latter’s
outer edges, thus leaving the cover pliable.</p>

<p><dfn>Cancels.</dfn> Leaves containing errors which are to
be cut out and replaced with corrected pages.</p>

the leather coverings of headbands. See Head
cap.</p>

<p><dfn>Case bindings.</dfn> The ordinary cloth binding of
commerce. Books in these bindings are folded and
sewn, rounded and backed by machinery. A machine
also makes the cases, covering the two pieces
of cardboard which form the sides with cloth as
needed. These cases are separately printed before
being put on the books. The book is then glued
and put into its case by machinery.</p>

<p><dfn>Catchword.</dfn> A word placed under the last line
on each page of some old-time books, the word being
the same as the first word on the next page; a direction
word.</p>

<p><dfn>Center tools.</dfn> Tools cut for ornamentation of
center of panels and sides of book covers.</p>

<p><dfn>Corners.</dfn> Leather pieces pasted on the corners
of a half-bound or three-quarter-bound book.</p>

<p><dfn>Cowhide.</dfn> The thick, coarse leather made from

as “American Russia,” or “imitation Russia.” It
is much used for binding popular books of fiction.
It has a slight grain or corrugation on the surface,
is tough and strong, takes gilding well, wears well and
if of best quality and handled much is usually quite
durable; that is, will last five or six years on popular
fiction.</p>

<p><dfn>Creaser.</dfn> The tool used in marking each side of
the bands, generally made of steel.</p>

<p><dfn>Cropped.</dfn> When a book has been cut down too

applied to morocco or its imitations. See Crushed
levant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p><dfn>Crushed levant.</dfn> Levant morocco with the grain
crushed down until the surface is smooth and highly
polished. In fine binding this is done by hand after
the leather is on the book. Most crushed levant
morocco, however, is surfaced by a machine before
it is applied to the book.</p>

<p><dfn>Cut edges.</dfn> See Edges cut.</p>

<p><dfn>Cut flush.</dfn> Means that the cloth cover, which is
usually limp (without boards), is drawn on the book

It is a suitable way of binding only when strength
and elegance are not required.</p>

<p><dfn>Cutter, or Cutting machine.</dfn> The machine on

the machine passes under this roller and is pressed
by it. It gives the laid or wove appearance to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
sheet, and when letters, figures, or other devices are
worked in fine wire on its surface it produces the
effect known as water-marking.</p>

<p><dfn>Deckle-edge.</dfn> The rough untrimmed edge of hand-made
paper. Deckle-edges are poorly imitated by
cutting and tearing machine-made paper, sometimes
with the aid of a jet of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p><dfn>Derome style.</dfn> This style has ornaments of a
leafy character, with a more solid face, though lightly
shaded by the graver. The ornaments are often
styled Renaissance, being an entire change from
the Gascon. The Derome is best exemplified in
borders, Vandyke in design; it is simple in construction
but rich in effect, and is appropriate for art
publications. Time, eighteenth century.</p>

<p><dfn>Diaper.</dfn> A term applied to a small repeating all-over
pattern. From woven material decorated in
this way.</p>

<p><dfn>Duck, sometimes called Canvas.</dfn> This is made
by many firms in a wide range of colors and qualities.
It is in fact a heavy cotton cloth. Slate-colored
duck 28 in. wide, 10 oz. to the yard, costs
about 20 cents per yard. This is a firmly woven,
smooth material. We have used a light green. It
takes printers’ ink for lettering fairly well, though it
soon soils if handled. It is a very desirable binding
for heavy books not much used. All such books
should be stiffened by pasting or gluing cloth on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
backs, if loose back, and should be reinforced at
head and tail.</p>

<p><dfn>Edges untouched.</dfn> A book or pamphlet with edges
uncut and unopened.</p>

of books, and to special editions which are in fact,
or are claimed to be, unusually well and expensively
made.</p>

<p><dfn>Embossed.</dfn> When a plate is so stamped upon a
sheet or cover as to produce a raised figure or design.</p>

<p><dfn>End leaves or Lining papers.</dfn> Are the sheets which
are pasted to the inside of the covers, and are either
plain white or colored, according to the style of binding.
Marbled papers are largely used on fine leather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
work. Sometimes in fine bindings the end leaves
are made of silk or leather.</p>

<p><dfn>End papers.</dfn> The papers placed at each end of
the volume and pasted down upon the boards. Also,

in England, and costing in this country about 70
cents per square yard. In De Jonge’s list (De Jonge,
dealer in leather, book cloths, etc., 69–73 Duane St.,
New York) it is called Low buckram. We have
used it for the backs of books, light and heavy. It
promises to stand indefinitely if not much handled.
Under handling it grows soft and flabby like other
book cloths, though not rapidly, and without losing
its strength. We have discarded it for the books
on which we first tried it, periodicals subject to much
use. It is not easy to letter in gold by hand, and
does not hold gold well under wear.</p>

<p><dfn>Eve style.</dfn> A framework of various geometrical-shaped
compartments linked together by interlaced
circles; the centers of the compartments are filled
with small floral ornaments and the irregular spaces
surrounding them with circular scrolls and branches
of laurel and palm. An elaborate style of the end of
the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p><dfn>Extra binding.</dfn> A trade term for the best work.</p>

decorated corner formed by fillets or curves, or both,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
are filled with little branches, vines, etc., the style
of decoration is said to be fanfare—from its first
having been used on a book of which this word
formed the principal part of the title.</p>

<p><dfn>Flexible glue.</dfn> This is usually made by adding
about two tablespoonfuls of glycerine to half a
pound of the glue in a dry state.</p>

<p>This glue used on the backs of books makes the

recommended for all books in all cases as the glycerine
tends to weaken the glue, at the same time
that it prevents it from becoming very hard.</p>

guarded or hinged throughout that they may open
freely. A narrow strip is cut from the back of each
leaf. This strip is then again attached to the leaf from

<p><dfn>Hand letters.</dfn> Letters fixed in handles; used
singly for lettering.</p>

<p><dfn>Head and tail.</dfn> The top and bottom of the back
of a book.</p>

<p><dfn>Headband.</dfn> The silk or cotton ornament worked
at the head and tail of a book to give it a finished
look, to strengthen it and to make the back even with
the squares or boards which form the sides. On
cheap binding the headband is cut from a strip of
machine-made material and pasted in merely for
ornament.</p>

<p><dfn>Heel-ball.</dfn> A preparation of wax used by shoemakers,
in the form of a ball, in burnishing the heels
of shoes.</p>

<p><dfn>Head cap.</dfn> The fold of leather over the headband.</p>

<p><dfn>Imitation Russia.</dfn> See Cowhide.</p>

<p><dfn>Imperial morocco cloth.</dfn> A grain-finished linen-thread
cloth manufactured by the Winterbottom
Book Cloth Company of England. It is made in
different colors; of these the library has tried but
one, the green. On books which have some, but
not constant use, it is a very good substitute for
leather. It takes lettering well, and wears better
than any of the cloths the library has tried. The
price is 48 cents per square yard by the roll, fast
color, duty paid. (De Jonge &amp; Co., 69–73 Duane
St., New York.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p><dfn>In boards.</dfn> When a book is cut after the boards
are affixed to form the sides, it is said to be cut in
boards. The term is also applied to a style of binding
in which the boards are covered with paper only.</p>

<p><dfn>Inset.</dfn> When one sheet is placed inside of another,
both being folded.</p>

<p><dfn>Inside margins.</dfn> The border made by the turn in
of the leather on the inside of boards.</p>

<p><dfn>Inside tins.</dfn> Sheets of tin; so called from being
placed inside the boards when a book is put in the
standing-press.</p>

<p><dfn>Jansen style.</dfn> Without line or ornament either
in blank or gold. It permits decoration on the inside
cover, but demands absolute plainness on the outside,
with the exception of lettering. It is only
appropriate for crushed levant, it being dependent
for its beauty on the polished surface of the leather.</p>

<p><dfn>Javelle water.</dfn> To one pound of chloride of lime
add four and a half pints of water, and put in a
jar with tight cover. Dissolve 20 oz. of ordinary
washing soda in four and a half pints of boiling
water, in a separate vessel, and immediately pour
into the first mixture. When cold add enough water
to make eleven pints in all. Strain through muslin,
settle, and pour off the clear solution. This will
remove many stains; but care must be taken to
rinse thoroughly the paper with water after using
it, as it tends to rot paper.</p>

<p><dfn>Joints.</dfn> The projections formed in backing to
admit the boards. Also the leather or cloth, with
its lining, where it passes from the book proper to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the boards when the volume is covered; that is, the
part of the binding that bends when the boards are
opened. See also French joint.</p>

<p><dfn>Justification.</dfn> The process of making the pages
of a book lie opposite one another to insure a straight
and equal margin throughout.</p>

<p><dfn>Keratol,</dfn> the B B B grade, or Buffingette manufactured
by the Keratol Company, cor. Clifford and
Van Buren Sts., Newark, N. J., at 35 cents per yard.
A waterproof cloth made in imitation of leather. It
is excellent for the sides of books which receive much
wear, as it does not show either finger or water marks,
and outlasts the ordinary book cloth. It cannot be
recommended for full binding as it is difficult to
letter and wears away quickly at the joints. At
first it has a disagreeable odor, but this wears off.
An objectionable feature is that labels cannot easily
be pasted upon it. To overcome this difficulty,
put a thin coat of shellac on the place where the label
is to go. The objectionable point mentioned is
overbalanced by the material’s good qualities.</p>

<p><dfn>Kettlestitch.</dfn> As the sewer draws the thread out
through the hole near the end of a signature she
passes it between the two preceding signatures and
around the thread which connects them, before she
passes it into the hole in the signature she next lays
on. This is called the kettle-stitch, a word said to
be a corruption of either catch-up stitch or chain
stitch.</p>

<p><dfn>Keys.</dfn> Little metal instruments used to secure
the bands to the sewing bench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p><dfn>Kip calf.</dfn> Made from the skin of a heifer; much
stronger than ordinary calf.</p>

<p><dfn>Knocking-down iron.</dfn> A heavy iron plate on which
are placed the sides of a laced-in book when the
lacings of string, tape or vellum, are pounded down
with a hammer so they will not show when the book
is covered.</p>

<p><dfn>Laced in.</dfn> When the boards are affixed to the
volume by passing the bands, strings, or tapes on
which it is sewn through holes made in the boards,
they are said to be laced in.</p>

<p><dfn>Laid paper.</dfn> Having lines water-marked in it,
running through it at equal distances apart, the lines
being thin places made by the pressure of projections
on the dandy-roll.</p>

<p><dfn>Laying press.</dfn> See Lying press.</p>

<p><dfn>Law sheep.</dfn> Law books are usually bound in sheep
left wholly uncolored, hence the term. Many law
books are now bound in buckram, canvas or duck.</p>

<p><dfn>Leatherette.</dfn> Cloth or paper made to look like
leather. There are many kinds used in binding,
some of which look very well and wear about as long
as poorer kinds of cloth.</p>

<p><dfn>Lettering block.</dfn> A piece of wood of about the
size and shape of a large book. Leather labels
which are to be lettered in gold are laid on the rounded
edge of this block that the pallet may be pressed on
them more readily.</p>

<p><dfn>Lettering box.</dfn> The iron box in which type are
screwed up preparatory to lettering. To the box
is attached a handle, the whole forming a pallet.</p>

<p><dfn>Lettering pallet.</dfn> See Pallet.</p>

<p><dfn>Levant morocco.</dfn> Originally made in the Levant
from the skins of Angora goats. A superior quality
of morocco, having a large and prominent grain.
French levant morocco has long held its place as the
best of all leathers for bookbinding.</p>

<p><dfn>Limp binding.</dfn> Binding with a thin and yielding
cover. A perfectly limp leather book can be rolled
up easily.</p>

<p><dfn>Linen.</dfn> See English linen.</p>

<p><dfn>Linen-finish buckram.</dfn> Polished buckram and
satin-finish book cloth. Manufactured by Jos. Bancroft
&amp; Sons Co., Rockford, near Wilmington, Del.
(New York agent, Albert D. Smith, 35–37 Thomas
St., New York.) The special features of these cloths,
in which it is claimed they are superior, are uniformity
of color, finish and fabric, wearing qualities,
tensile strength, and easy application of decoration,
ink or metal.</p>

<p><dfn>Lining papers.</dfn> The colored or marbled paper at
each end of a book. Called also End papers, which
see.</p>

<p><dfn>Loose back.</dfn> See Back, tight and loose.</p>

<p><dfn>Low buckram.</dfn> See English linen.</p>

<p><dfn>Lying press.</dfn> The term applied to the under side
of the cutting press when used for backing. Usually
called laying press.</p>

<p><dfn>Maioli style.</dfn> A style prior to and contemporary
with the early (Italian) examples of the Grolier.
Generally composed of a framework of shields or
medallions, with a design of scrollwork flowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
through it. Portions of the design are usually
studded with gold dots. Ornaments are of moresque
character.</p>

<p><dfn>Marbled calf.</dfn> Calf so treated with acid that it
bears some resemblance to marble.</p>

<p><dfn>Marbler.</dfn> A workman who marbles the edges of the
leaves.</p>

<p><dfn>Marbling.</dfn> A process of decorating sheets of paper
and edges of books with variegated colors in irregular
patterns.</p>

<p><dfn>Millboard.</dfn> The boards that are attached to the
book to form the covers. Several kinds are in use
now; the best is made of old naval cordage.</p>

<p><dfn>Millboard machine.</dfn> See Board cutter.</p>

<p><dfn>Mitred.</dfn> When the lines in finishing intersect
each other at right angles and are continued without
overrunning each other, they are said to be mitred.</p>

<p><dfn>Morocco.</dfn> Leather made from goatskins, tanned
with sumac, originally made in the Barbary states,
but afterwards very largely in the Levant, and now
produced in Europe and America from skins imported
from Asia and Africa. The peculiar qualities of
true morocco are great firmness of texture, with
flexibility, and a grained surface, of which there are
many varieties. This surface is produced by a process
which consists largely in rolling and folding,
called graining. True morocco is of extreme hardness,
and makes the most durable book bindings;
it is used also for upholstering seats and for similar
purposes, and to a certain extent in shoemaking.</p>

<p>“Early specimens of red morocco, from the sixteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to the end of the eighteenth century, were
found in good condition, and of all leathers noticed
this seems to be the least affected. In the opinion
of the committee, most of this leather has been
tanned with sumac or some closely allied tanning
material. Morocco bindings earlier than 1860 were
generally found to be in fairly good condition; but
morocco after that date seems to be much less reliable,
and in many cases has become utterly rotten.”—Report ’01.</p>

<p>Leather called morocco, sometimes with a qualifying
adjective, is now made in Europe and America.
Much of this is very good, even when made, as it
often is, from other skins than those of goats. Even
the experts seem often unable to distinguish the
good from the best. None of it is to be condemned
or approved because it is or is not made in the Levant,
or from goatskins.</p>

<p><dfn>Morocco.</dfn> The name given to any imitation,
often made of sheepskin, of the genuine morocco.</p>

<p><dfn>Morocco.</dfn> For Bock, French, Levant, Persian,
Turkey morocco, see the several words.</p>

<p><dfn>Morocco cloth.</dfn> See Imperial morocco cloth.</p>

<p><dfn>Mosaic binding.</dfn> A binding of leather decorated
with designs made in whole or in part by inlaying
pieces of leather or other material of different colors.
The designs are usually outlined with gold.</p>

<p><dfn>Mottled calf.</dfn> A light brown calf bookbinding,
made to look mottled by treatment with acid.</p>

<p><dfn>Niger goatskin.</dfn> Brought from Africa by the Royal
Niger Company. A native production. It has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
very beautiful color and texture, with no grain. It
has stood all the tests given it without serious deterioration.
It does not keep clean under handling as
well as a good coarse-grained morocco. Especially
recommended by the committee appointed to investigate
leather by the Society of Arts, of England.</p>

<p><dfn>Octavo.</dfn> A sheet of paper folded into eight leaves,
being, when folded, about 8½ × 5½ inches; usually
written 8vo.</p>

<p><dfn>Off-set.</dfn> The impression made by print against
the opposite page, when a book has been rolled or
beaten before the ink is dried; also called Set-off.</p>

<p><dfn>Opened edges.</dfn> See Edges opened.</p>

<p><dfn>Out of boards.</dfn> When a volume is cut before the
boards are affixed it is done “out of boards.” Nearly
all work is now done out of boards.</p>

<p><dfn>Overcasting.</dfn> Sewing the leaves or signatures of
a book together over and over. Usually done only
when the book consists of single leaves or plates;
but is quite commonly employed now in rebinding
books, especially on the last two or three signatures
front and back. Also called whip-stitching. Probably
90 per cent. of the books published today will
stand wear better if they are properly overcast
than if they are sewed in the ordinary way.</p>

<p><dfn>Pallet.</dfn> Name given to the tool used in gilding
upon the bands; sometimes applied to the steel box,
with a handle, in which letters are fastened when
they are pressed upon the back.</p>

<p><dfn>Panel.</dfn> The space between bands; also applied
to beveled and sunk sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p><dfn>Paneling.</dfn> The sides of books are sometimes
ornamented with sunken panels. Paneled covers
are usually made of wood and covered with leather,
though sometimes a paneled effect is produced on
cardboards by heavy pressure.</p>

<p><dfn>Payne, Roger, style.</dfn> The ornaments of this style
are easily identified, being free and flowing in stem
and flower; whereas before Payne’s time they had been
stiff and formal. The honeysuckle is a customary
ornament. The impressions of the tools are usually
studded round with gold dots, whether used in borders,
corners, or centerpieces. The style is well
suited for early nineteenth century literature, especially
poetry.</p>

<p><dfn>Pebble grained.</dfn> See Grain.</p>

<p><dfn>Persian morocco.</dfn> A kind of morocco leather
much used in bookbinding. It may be finished by
graining in several styles. It is mostly made in
Germany, from the skins of hairy sheep called Persian
goats, whence its name is derived.</p>

<p>“East Indian or ‘Persian’ tanned sheep and goatskins,
called ‘Persian morocco’ or ‘Persian sheep,’
now used largely for cheap bookbinding purposes, are
extremely bad. Books bound in these materials have
been found to show decay in less than 12 months and
probably no book bound in these leathers, exposed on
a shelf to sunlight or gas fumes, can be expected to
last more than five or six years.”—Report ’01.</p>

<p><dfn>Petits Fers.</dfn> Small hand tools used in finishing,
as distinguished from the stamps or blocks worked
in a press.</p>

<p><dfn>Pieced.</dfn> When the space between bands, where
lettering or title is placed, has fastened to it a piece
of leather different from the back, it is said to be
pieced or titled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p><dfn>Pigskin.</dfn> Leather made of pigskin. It is very
tough and if constantly handled wears well.</p>

<p>“Modern pigskin, if genuine, seems to last very
well in some colors and in an undyed condition;
but some colored pigskin bindings have utterly perished.
Pigskin is naturally hard and rather stiff
leather and is suitable for large books rather than
small, and for books which are much handled.” “If
submitted to severe softening processes in manufacture
its durability is very small.”—Report ’01.</p>

<p>Chivers has used a soft, thin pigskin with great
success, here and in England.</p>

<p><dfn>Plate.</dfn> An illustration printed from a plate.
Term often incorrectly applied to illustrations printed
from wood-cuts. Also, any full page illustration
printed on paper different from that of the rest of the
book is usually called a “plate.”</p>

<p><dfn>Plough.</dfn> An instrument used in cutting the edges
of books and boards.</p>

<p><dfn>Pressing boards.</dfn> Boards put between books when
they are pressed. They are usually made of carefully
seasoned wood, and have a heavy strip of brass
about their edges, which projects a little above the
board’s surface. Books are laid on the boards with
their backs projecting over this band enough to bring
the latter exactly into the groove of the joint. Another
board is laid on these books in the same position
as the first, and so on. All are then pressed.</p>

<p><dfn>Russia leather.</dfn> A fine leather prepared in Russia,
and imitated elsewhere, by very careful willowbark
tanning, dyeing with sandalwood, and soaking in
birch oil. It is of a brownish red color, and has a
peculiar and characteristic odor. The genuine is
not often used in binding; it is not as strong as
cowhide.</p>

<p>“In nearly all samples of Russia leather a very
violent form of red decay was noticed. In many
cases the leather was found to be absolutely rotten
in all parts exposed to light and air, so that on the

<p><dfn>Sewing bench.</dfn> A board from one side of which
rise two sticks across which is a bar, which can be
moved up and down and fixed in any desired position.
Strings, bands, or tapes are stretched vertically
between the edge of the board and the cross bar;
against these the signatures of a book are successively
placed and to them sewed.</p>

<p><dfn>Sheepskin.</dfn> The commonest leather used for binding.
When unsplit it is called Roan. When split
in two, the upper half is called Skiver, the under
or fleshy half a Flesher. This leather is easy to work,
takes gold lettering easily, and looks fairly well on
a book. But it is not strong, and most kinds dry
out and break within three to five years, even if
much handled. The leather made from the skin
of the sheep is not all alike. The remark already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
made, that a given piece of leather is not to be
condemned for its name, applies to all the other
leathers in this list. The skin from some mountain-bred
sheep, for example, if well tanned, makes a
good leather.</p>

<p>“Sheepskin bindings of the early part of the
century are many of them still in good condition.
Sheepskin, in a fairly natural state, seems to keep
its flexibility, but it is very easily damaged by friction.
Since about 1860 sheepskin as sheepskin is
hardly to be found. We have instead sheepskins
grained in imitation of various other leathers, and
these imitation grained leathers are, generally speaking,
in a worse condition than any others, excepting,
perhaps, some of the very thin calf bindings.”—Report
’01.</p>

<p><dfn>Shelf-back.</dfn> The back of the book, showing the
title, bands, decorations, etc.</p>

indicate the order of its arrangement in the book;
often applied to the sheet itself.</p>

<p><dfn>Sixteenmo.</dfn> A sheet folded into sixteen leaves,

which has been split. It is commonly the
thinner of the two parts, as when the inner is prepared
for chamois. It usually looks well, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
